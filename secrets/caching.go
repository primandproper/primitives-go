// NewCachingSource wraps source in a read-through cache whose entries live for
// ttl, so repeated reads of a secret cost one backend round-trip per TTL
// instead of one per call.
//
// It exists because the alternative callers reach for is worse. A GetSecret
// against GCP or SSM is a network call, which pushes every caller toward
// resolving at boot and holding the value for the life of the process — and
// that is precisely the shape that turns a key rotation into an outage, since
// nothing in the process can react to the backend's value changing. A TTL is
// the smallest thing that fixes both halves: the round-trip is amortized, and
// the value is re-read often enough that a rotation is noticed.
//
// Pair it with WithRefresh to keep entries warm in the background, and with
// OnChange to be told when a re-read sees a new value. Refresh is what moves
// the round-trip off the hot path entirely; OnChange is what lets a caller
// re-derive whatever it built out of the old value — a signing keyring, a
// database credential, an SDK client — without a restart.
//
// The TTL must be positive. Close closes the wrapped source, so a caller closes
// what this returns and nothing else.
//
// # What is and is not cached
//
// A secret the backend reports as absent is not cached: ErrSecretNotFound goes
// straight back to the caller and nothing is stored, so a secret created after
// this source started is visible on the next read rather than a TTL later. For
// the same reason a re-read that comes back ErrSecretNotFound drops whatever
// was held — an affirmative "no such secret" is an answer, not a failed lookup,
// and a deleted secret must stop being served.
//
// Every other backend failure is treated as a failure to reach an answer, not
// as an answer. A read whose fetch fails is served the held value if there is
// one, counted as a stale read, and reported on the staleness gauge; a
// background refresh that fails leaves the entry alone and logs. Old secret
// beats no secret for every purpose except revocation, and revocation outlives
// any TTL a process could pick anyway.
