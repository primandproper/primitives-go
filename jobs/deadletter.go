// DeadLetter is the envelope a Pool hands to its DeadLetterFunc once a message

// something failed but not what, and the failure is the only reason the record
// exists.

// but does not resurrect the message — there is nowhere left to put it. Alert
// on that counter, since every increment is a lost message.

// the same wire shape as the source topic. A replay tool reads DeadLetter,
// base64-decodes Payload, and publishes those bytes back to Topic.
