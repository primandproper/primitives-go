// Schedule decides when a job fires next.

// instant" is one method away: a schedule read from a table, one that stops
// after a date, one that skips holidays. Any robfig/cron Schedule satisfies
// this as-is, so a caller that wants seconds-resolution specs or the
// non-standard field extensions can bring its own parser and pass the result
// straight to Job.Schedule.
//
// Next reports the first fire time strictly after `after`, or the zero time to
// say the schedule will never fire again. It is called on the goroutine that
// owns the job, between runs rather than during them, and must not block.

// # Which zone
//
// Four things can decide it, and the most specific wins:
//
//  1. A CRON_TZ= or TZ= prefix on the spec itself.
//  2. The location passed to CronIn.
//  3. SchedulerConfig.Timezone, applied to the schedules of jobs registered
//     with that Scheduler that did not settle the question themselves.
//  4. UTC.
//
// UTC rather than the host's local time, because the underlying parser defaults
// to time.Local and Go builds time.Local from the process's TZ environment
// variable. That makes the same expression mean different instants on a laptop
// and in a container, and lets one replica of a service disagree with another
// about when 03:00 is, without either of them saying anything about it.
//
// Any zone other than UTC needs the zoneinfo database at runtime. Scratch and
// distroless images generally do not have it, and the lookup fails there rather
// than silently choosing a different zone; `import _ "time/tzdata"` in the
// binary's main package embeds it.
//
// # Daylight saving
//
// A wall-clock schedule in a zone that observes it has two days a year where
// "it runs at 03:00" is not the whole answer. An hour that does not exist on
// the spring-forward day does not run; an hour that happens twice on the
// fall-back day runs twice, an hour apart — and the lease does not prevent the
// second run, having been released an hour earlier. A job that must not miss or
// repeat wants UTC.
//
// # Catch-up
//
// There is none. A fire time that passes while the process is down, or while a
// previous run of the same job is still going, is skipped rather than queued —
// see the Scheduler docs for why, and Job.RunOnStart for the escape hatch when
// a job must not be skipped by a deploy.
