// containedPanic turns a panic that panicking.Contain caught into one of this
// package's sentinels, counting it and putting its stack on the span. Anything
// that is not a contained panic is returned untouched.
//
// The Pool and the Scheduler both need this and neither can borrow the other's:
// they count against different instruments and report different sentinels. What
// they must not differ on is the order — the stack has to reach the span before
// the PanicError is replaced, since the wrapped sentinel no longer carries it —
// which is why the sequence lives here once rather than in two deferred blocks
// that could drift.
//
// Call it from a deferred closure over a named error result:
//
