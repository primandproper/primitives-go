// Package noop is the partitioned.KeyedCircuitBreaker that never opens for any
// key. For hands back one shared circuitbreaking/noop breaker rather than a
// breaker per key, which is safe only because that breaker holds no state:
// there is nothing per-key to keep, so there is no reason to allocate per key
// or to bound the map that would hold them.
//
// Selecting it means no partition is ever isolated from any other. The reason
// to key a breaker at all is that one bad tenant, shard, or upstream trips only
// its own circuit and leaves the rest alone; here nothing trips, so a failing
// partition keeps taking traffic beside the healthy ones and the blast radius
// is once again the whole service.
