// DefaultErrorBodyLimit is how much of a refused response's body a StatusError
// keeps when no other bound is named.
//
// 512 bytes is enough for every error shape a service designs on purpose — a
// JSON problem document, a validation list, a plain sentence — and short enough
// that the shapes nobody designed, an HTML error page from a load balancer or a
// stack trace from a framework's debug mode, cost one log line rather than a
// log budget.

// DefaultContentType is the encoding an exchange uses when WithContentType
// names none.
//
// It is JSON because that is what almost every service-to-service call in front
// of this package speaks, and for no stronger reason than that. It is a default
// and not a rule: every content type the encoding package implements is a peer
// here, reachable by naming it, and nothing in an exchange is written in terms
// of JSON specifically.

// ExchangeOption customizes a single exchange. Options are applied in order, so

//
// It is per call rather than per client because what it governs is per call:
// the headers this request needs, the encoding this endpoint speaks, and how
// much of its error body is worth keeping. Everything durable about a client —
// its timeout, its transports, its observability — is an Option on
// NewHTTPClient, and nothing here is a second way to set any of it.

// costs: an ignored empty header name sends the request the caller meant, while
// a content type silently replaced by JSON sends a request some server will
// answer, wrongly, and nothing will say so.

// vendor media type in place of the Accept and Content-Type this package fills
// in. Credentials that hold for every call belong further down — in a transport
