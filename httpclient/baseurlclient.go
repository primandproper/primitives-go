//
//	leader, err := httpclient.NewBaseURLClient(client, "https://leader.internal/api")
//	claim, err := httpclient.Exchange[ClaimResponse](ctx, leader, http.MethodPost, "/v1/claim", request)
//
// It is a Doer itself, so it goes anywhere one does and composes with nothing
// else: the client it wraps keeps every transport it was built with, and this
// adds no behavior beyond resolving the URL.
//
// The joining is url.URL.JoinPath's, which is the reason to have this at all.
// Concatenating a configured base and a literal path is where the double slash
// and the missing slash come from, and both produce a request that reaches a
// real server and gets a 404 — the failure mode that looks like the service is
// broken rather than like the URL is.
//
// A request whose URL is already absolute passes through untouched, so a caller
// with one endpoint elsewhere does not need a second client.

// surprise to somebody, and a caller who wants a parameter on every request has
// a clearer place to put it than a URL.
//
// Its path is a prefix, not a document: "https://host/api" and
// "https://host/api/" both resolve "/v1/claim" to "https://host/api/v1/claim",
// which is the one thing string concatenation and url.URL.ResolveReference each
// get wrong in a different direction.
