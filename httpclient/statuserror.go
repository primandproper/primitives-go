// StatusError is a response an exchange would not accept: a status outside 2xx.
//
// It carries what an operator reading the log line actually needs — which
// request, what the server said, and what the server said about it — and it
// carries the status code so a caller can branch on a 404 without parsing a
// string.
//
// Match it with errors.As. It also matches retry.ErrUnretryable under errors.Is
// for the statuses DefaultRetryClassification calls terminal, which is what
// lets a caller's own retry loop stop on a 400 and keep trying a 429 without
// writing that rule a second time.
type StatusError struct {
	// Method is the request method, so a log line says what was attempted and
	// not only where.
	Method string

	// Path is the request's path. Not the full URL: the host is the caller's
	// own configuration and adds nothing to a message about the response, and a
	// query string is exactly where a token or a customer identifier ends up —
	// which is a poor thing to put in a string destined for a log.
	Path string

	// Status is the status line as the server sent it, "404 Not Found".
	Status string

	// Body is the response body, whitespace-trimmed and cut to at most
	// WithErrorBodyLimit bytes on a rune boundary. Truncated says whether the
	// cut happened; Binary says whether there was a body that is not here.
	Body string

	// ContentType is the response's Content-Type header as the server sent it,
	// which may be empty. It is what makes a Binary error legible: the number of
	// bytes alone does not say whether the server answered CBOR or a proxy
	// answered a gzip stream.
	ContentType string

	// StatusCode is the response status code.
	StatusCode int

	// BodySize is how many bytes of the body were read — at most
	// WithErrorBodyLimit, plus the one byte used to detect truncation. It is not
	// the size of the body the server sent, which is the point: nothing here
	// reads far enough to know that.
	BodySize int

	// Truncated reports whether the server's body was longer than the limit, so
	// a reader knows the message ends because the bound was reached rather than
	// because the server had nothing more to say.
	Truncated bool

	// Binary reports that the server sent a body which is not text, so Body is
	// empty and BodySize and ContentType are all that is kept of it.
	//
	// An exchange over CBOR is the case this exists for. Its error bodies are
	// bytes, and a bounded prefix of them run through a string is mojibake in a
	// log line — the sort that arrives at a UTF-8 column or a JSON log encoder
	// and fails there, one layer away from anything that explains why.
	Binary bool

// newStatusError renders a refused response as an error, reading no more of its
// body than the limit allows.
//
// The bound is on the read and not merely on the string, which is the whole
// point of having one. A proxy's HTML error page runs to megabytes, and
// buffering it in order to throw all but 512 bytes of it away is the incident
// this is meant to prevent, not a smaller version of it. The cost is that the
// connection is not reusable when a body is left unread, which is a fair price
// on a path that has already failed.
//
// Whether the bytes are text is decided by looking at them rather than at the
// exchange's content type, because the two are routinely different: a CBOR
// endpoint's 502 comes from a proxy that has never heard of CBOR and answers
// HTML, and a JSON endpoint behind a misconfigured gateway can answer a gzip
// stream. What was actually read is the only thing that settles it.

// mid-character about three times in four — and judging that invalid would
// withhold exactly the long error bodies the bound exists to make affordable.
//
