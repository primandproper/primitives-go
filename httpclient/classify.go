// Outcome is what one completed exchange taught us about the host it was sent

// OutcomeClassifier decides what a finished request says about the health of

//
// Unlike RetryClassifier it receives the transport error as well as the
// response, because a dial failure or a reset is exactly the kind of evidence a
// breaker exists to accumulate — there, the absence of a response is the
// finding. When err is non-nil, resp is nil.
//

// differs from the standard's — which is most hosts. Delegating to
// DefaultOutcome for everything a classifier does not have an opinion about

// no reason to cut off every other caller of the same host.
//
// A request this client's own limiter refused is ignored outright. It never
// reached the host, so it is evidence about the local budget and none at all
// about the dependency's health; counting it would let ordinary throttling trip
// a circuit against a host that is perfectly well — and then keep it tripped,
// since the refusals continue whether or not the host recovers.

//     attempts that remain.
//   - any other error asks for another attempt, subject to the policy.

// The error a classifier returns is what the retry.Policy sees, so it is worth
// making descriptive; it is not what the caller of the HTTP client gets back,
// since a request that produced a response returns that response either way.
//
// It is asked only about responses. A transport error — a dial failure, a
// reset, a timeout — is always retryable, because it means no answer arrived at
// all and that is the failure retrying exists for.
