// observedTransport opens one span covering the logical request the caller
// made, as distinct from the attempts it took to answer it.
//
// It is the outermost layer, above the circuit breaker, and it exists because
// the resilience stack otherwise leaves two holes in a trace:
//
// The tracing transport sits below the retry loop, which is correct — each
// attempt should be its own client span rather than one span smeared across a
// loop — but it means three attempts arrive as three sibling spans with nothing
// tying them to the one call the caller believes it made. This is their parent.
//
// And a request the breaker or the limiter refuses never reaches the tracing
// transport at all, so it produces no span whatsoever. A dependency this client
// has stopped talking to entirely is exactly the thing you want to find in a
// trace, and it was the one thing that could not be found there.
