// RegisterHTTPClient registers an *http.Client with the injector, built from the
// injector's *Config. Any opts are applied after the Config and so override it.
//
// Observability comes from the injector's pillars when it has any. A container
// that registers none still wires up — every pillar resolves to its noop — but
// one whose registered provider fails to build reports that rather than
// degrading to a client that looks instrumented and records nowhere.
//
// The resilience and cache collaborators are deliberately not resolved here. A
// RateLimiter or CircuitBreaker in a container is far more often the one
// guarding the service's own inbound API, and silently repurposing it to
// throttle outbound calls would be a surprise nobody asked for. A registered
// cache.Cache is the service's own for the same reason, and filling it with
// third-party HTTP responses would evict what it was built to hold. They pass
// as options like everything else.
