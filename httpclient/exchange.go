// codecs is every encoding an exchange can speak, one client-side codec per
// content type the encoding package implements.
//
// It is built from encoding.ContentTypes rather than from a list written out
// here, so an encoding added there is reachable from an exchange without this
// package being touched, and so the set this package speaks cannot drift from
// the set that package implements. A lookup that misses is the only definition
// of "unsupported" this package has.
//
// They are the encoding package's client seam rather than encoding/json and its
// counterparts directly, which is what the rest of this module reaches for
// whenever a value has to become bytes; the JSON codec's output is
// byte-for-byte json.Marshal's. None of them is the ServerEncoderDecoder, which
// is about writing responses and has no business here.
//
// No observability is attached, because there is nothing here for it to say
// that the caller's own span does not already cover — a marshal of a struct the
// caller just built, and an unmarshal of a body the transport already traced.

// Doer sends a prepared request and returns the response. *http.Client is the

// It is an interface rather than *http.Client for two reasons, both about what
// can be substituted for a client: BaseURLClient wraps one so a call site can
// name a path instead of a URL, and a test can answer an exchange without
// standing up a server. Neither is a place to reimplement a client — a Doer
// that is not, eventually, an *http.Client built by this package has none of
// the retrying, breaking, or limiting that everything below assumes has already

// It exists because "decode the body into Out" and "there is no body" are
// different requests, and the alternative — inferring one from an empty body —
// would turn a server that answered 200 with nothing into a silent zero value
// for every caller who did expect a body.
//
// The body is closed but not read, so a server that sent one anyway costs this
// exchange its connection and nothing else.

// # The encoding is a choice, and JSON is only its default
//
// WithContentType names the encoding, over any content type the encoding
// package implements — JSON, XML, TOML, YAML, CBOR, Ecoji. Unnamed, it is
// DefaultContentType, which is JSON because that is what the overwhelming
// majority of these calls speak, not because this package treats JSON as the
// encoding and the rest as exceptions.
//
// A content type this package cannot speak is an error rather than a fallback,
// the same answer encoding.ParseContentType gives, and for the same reason:
// silently standing in for JSON would turn a typo into a request that reaches a
// real server and is misunderstood by it.
//

//		httpclient.WithContentType(encoding.ContentTypeCBOR),

//
// # The exchange itself
//
// A nil in sends no body at all — not an encoded null — and sets no
// Content-Type. Anything else is marshaled, and the bytes are held rather than
// streamed, so the request carries a GetBody and a retrying client can replay
// it.
//
// Every request asks for its own content type back in Accept, and the reply is
// decoded with that same codec whatever the response's Content-Type says. That
// leniency is deliberate: a server that answers JSON while labeling it
// text/plain is common, and reading the response header instead would refuse
// precisely the case the leniency exists for. The codec is the caller's
// statement of what it expects, not a guess at what arrived.
//
// A status outside 2xx is a *StatusError carrying the status, the request path,
// and a bounded prefix of the body — see WithErrorBodyLimit. Out is the zero
// value for every error this returns, including that one: a failed exchange
// decodes nothing, so there is no half-populated value to mistake for an
// answer.
//
// # It adds no resilience of its own
//
// Retrying, circuit breaking, rate limiting, and caching belong to the
// transports doer was built with, and are already finished by the time this
// reads a status. A helper that retried on top of them would give a client
// configured with WithRetryPolicy two nested loops and a caller no way to
// predict how many requests one call makes.
//
// What the error does carry is the classification those transports already use.
// A *StatusError whose status DefaultRetryClassification calls terminal matches
// retry.ErrUnretryable, so a caller wrapping a whole operation — several
// exchanges, or an exchange plus the work around it — in a retry.Policy of its
// own stops on a 400 and keeps trying a 429, without restating the rule.
