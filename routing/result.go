// It travels the error path rather than being quietly replaced by the
// registered status. A Result carrying 42 is a defect in the handler, and
// answering the client as though the handler had named nothing hides it for as
// long as nobody reads the response codes. Zero is not this — see Result.

// Four are refused, each because setting it would produce a response that
// contradicts itself rather than one that carries the handler's intent:
//
//   - Content-Type is the route encoder's, and the media type recorded in the
//     generated document. The encoder sets it immediately before writing, so a
//     handler's value would be overwritten without a word — and if it were not,
//     the response would disagree with its own OpenAPI entry.
//   - Content-Length is computed from what is actually written. A handler's
//     number is either the same one or a truncated response.
//   - Transfer-Encoding and Connection are framing, which net/http owns for the
//     whole connection rather than for one response.
//
// Refusing is the point: each of these fails silently or corruptly if allowed,
// and none of them is recoverable once the status is on the wire.

// Result pairs a handler's response value with the status it is answered with,

// answers 201 or 200 depending on what it did to a body that looks the same
// either way, and a readiness probe, which reports one body shape with 200 when
// the service is healthy and 503 when it is not:

// It is opt-in per route: a handler returning T is unaffected, and one
// returning Result[T] is answered exactly as the T inside it would have been,
// at the status it names. The envelope, the generated schema, and the encoded
// bytes are the T's — Result is unwrapped before any of them, never encoded.
//
// Status and Header travel together because the headers worth setting per
// response are the ones a chosen status implies: Location belongs to the 201 an
// upsert returns when it created something, and Retry-After to a 503. Splitting
// them would mean two mechanisms that are only ever correct when used together.
//
// # Why the status rides the return
//
// Because it is a return value. Reaching the status through the context would
// put it where nothing in the signature says it can be, and make a handler
// tested by direct call silently unable to set it. Here a handler that names a
// status has said so in the value it returns, and a test reads it off the
// Result without a router.
//
// # Zero
//
// A zero Status means "the registered status", so a handler that names one on
// only some paths does not have to restate the default on the others, and the
// zero Result returned beside an error names nothing.
//
// # Documentation
//
// The registered status is still the documented one. A route that answers more
// declares the others with WithAdditionalResponse, as above. Nothing can infer
// them: the status is chosen per response, and the reflected type says only
// that a Result was returned, not what it will carry.
