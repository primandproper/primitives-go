// Package httpmw holds the net/http middleware stack shared by every routing
// backend. Each backend exposes an http.Handler for its mux or engine and wraps
// it with the same observability, recovery, CORS, and request-ID middleware, so
// the behavior lives here once rather than being copied per backend.
//
// chi consumes it too, through chi.Router.Use, which takes the same plain
// func(http.Handler) http.Handler that Chain composes. What chi does not share
// is the OpenTelemetry step — it instruments with otelchi, which reads chi's
// RouteContext and can therefore name a span after the matched route where the
// generic otelhttp wrapper here can only name it after the method. That one
// difference is why Standard exposes the stack as a slice: chi rebuilds the
// same order around its own otel middleware rather than copying the rest.
//
// Standard itself is for the backends that take otelMiddleware as given
// (stdlib, httprouter, gin).
