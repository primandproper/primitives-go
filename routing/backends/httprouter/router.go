// Package httprouter provides a routing.Backend built on
// julienschmidt/httprouter, a fast radix-tree router. httprouter uses ":name"
// path parameters, so the "/users/{id}" patterns the routing layer produces are
// rewritten to "/users/:id" at registration; path values are read back from the
// request context httprouter populates. httprouter matches on the decoded
// request path and offers no way to change that, so the lookup for a request
// carrying a percent-escaped path value is taken here instead — see
// escapedPathDispatch. The shared observability, recovery,
// CORS, and OpenTelemetry middleware stack is applied around the router,
// matching the chi backend's behavior.

// It is only the decision that moves. Lookup neither reads nor writes the

// so the ordinary path is byte-for-byte what it was. The escaped path then has
// to answer for itself, because "no route" and "wrong method" are different
// answers and a caller is owed the right one: a match runs, a trailing-slash
// near-miss redirects, and a path that exists under another verb is a 405 with
// an Allow header, all decided on the escaped form.
//
// Anything left over falls through to ServeHTTP on the decoded path, which is
// what httprouter did before. That keeps RedirectFixedPath — its case-insensitive
// fixup reaches through an unexported tree method, so it cannot be mirrored here,
// and the shared middleware stack deliberately leaves path normalization to the
// router. The cost is one asymmetry: where the escaped path matches nothing at
