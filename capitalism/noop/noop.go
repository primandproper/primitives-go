// Package noop holds the capitalism implementations a deployment that does not

// NewPaymentManager is loud. CreateCustomer, CreatePaymentIntent, and

// empty IDs and nil errors they once returned, because an empty customer ID
// stored as though it were real is a bug that surfaces months later against a
// provider that has never heard of the account. Its webhook handler is the
// exception and accepts what it is given: no provider exists to have sent the
// event, so ignoring it is the honest answer.
//
// NewUsageReporter is quiet. ReportUsage succeeds and posts nowhere, which is
// what a deployment that meters internally without billing wants — usage still
// accumulates durably and quotas are still enforced. That is a normal
// configuration rather than a degraded one, which is why it does not error.
//
// capitalism/config builds either for the "noop" provider name.
