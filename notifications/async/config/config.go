// Package asynccfg selects and builds an async.AsyncNotifier from configuration:
// Pusher, Ably, WebSocket, SSE, or noop.
//
// The providers split into two classes, and the split is a deployment constraint
// rather than a preference. Pusher and Ably are fleet-safe, because a hosted
// broker holds the connections. WebSocket and SSE hold them in this process's
// memory and are therefore correct at exactly one replica.
//
// That is why this config carries Topology, which no sibling seam does. A
// process cannot count its own replicas, so nothing here can tell a correct
// single-replica deployment from one that silently stopped delivering half its
// notifications when it scaled out. Selecting a self-hosted provider requires
// declaring the topology, which turns the assumption into something somebody
// wrote down.

//   - websocket and sse hold connections in the publishing process, and are
