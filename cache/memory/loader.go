//
// Returning cache.ErrNotFound means the key genuinely has no value; the caller's
// Get returns cache.ErrNotFound and nothing is stored, so absence is not cached.
// Returning (nil, nil) is a value — a nil *T is stored and served like any
// other, which is how a loader says "the answer is nothing" rather than "there
// is no answer". Any other error is returned to the caller as-is and, again,
// nothing is stored: a failed computation must not become a cached one.

// WithLoader makes the cache read through to loader: a Get that misses runs the
// loader, stores what it returns, and returns it, and concurrent misses on one
// key produce a single loader call whose result they all share.
//
// Without it the cache only answers for what has been written to it, so every
// caller that misses computes its own value. For a memo in front of an
// expensive computation — an aggregate query, a remote fetch — that turns each
// expiry into a thundering herd, one computation per concurrent reader, which
// is the load the memo was added to remove.
//
// GetMany reads through too, loading its missing keys concurrently. The
// concurrency is the batch's, so a caller handing it a thousand missing keys
// gets a thousand loads in flight; batch size is the caller's to choose, and a
// loader that must not be called that widely should limit itself.
//
// The loader runs on a context detached from the cancellation of whichever
// caller happened to start it, since its result belongs to every caller waiting
// on it and one of them giving up must not cancel the others' computation.
// Values and the surrounding trace carry over; deadlines do not, so a loader
// that needs a time limit has to impose its own. A caller whose own context
// ends first stops waiting and gets that context's error, while the load
// continues for the others.
//
// T is inferred from the loader, so this needs no type argument:
//
//	memory.WithLoader(func(ctx context.Context, key string) (*Stats, error) {
//		return q.aggregate(ctx, key)
//	})
//
// It must match the cache it configures. Because Option carries no type
// parameter, a loader for the wrong type cannot be rejected by the compiler;
// NewInMemoryCache returns ErrLoaderTypeMismatch instead, at construction.
