	// Cache is our wrapper interface for a cache. Batched reads, writes, and
	// deletes are part of the interface — every provider implements them, and
	// batching is the primary access pattern for high-volume consumers.
	//
	// Writes accept optional WriteOptions. A write with no options (or a zero
	// expiry) uses the cache's configured default expiry; WithExpiry overrides
	// it per call, and WithExpiry(NoExpiry) pins the entry against expiry
	// entirely.
	//
	// Keys are scoped to the cache instance: a provider with a configured
	// namespace prepends it to every key transparently, so callers never see
	// or supply namespaced keys. There is deliberately no way to reach
	// entries outside the cache's own namespace — a generic
	// inspect-everything client is a debugging tool, not a production
	// surface, and belongs in a separate Debug type if it is ever needed.

		// reporting ErrNotFound without writing when it does not. It is the
		// conditional half of Set, and it resolves WriteOptions the same way.
		//
		// It exists because "update what is there, and do not create it" is not
		// expressible as a read followed by a Set. Between those two calls the
		// entry can be deleted, and the Set then puts it back — which for a
		// caller whose deletes mean something (a revoked session, a released
		// claim) undoes the delete rather than losing a race harmlessly. This
		// is one operation and cannot be interleaved with one.
		//
		// It is not a compare-and-swap: it tests existence, not the value. A
		// caller that must not overwrite a *changed* value wants a lock — see
		// distributedlock — and the two compose, since this narrows what the
		// lock has to cover rather than replacing it.
		//
		// Providers that store nothing report ErrNotFound always, because
		// nothing is ever present in them. That makes a noop cache visibly
		// unable to serve a caller who needs this, which is the honest answer:
		// reporting success would claim a conditional write happened against a
		// store that holds no conditions.

		// Close releases the resources the cache holds — a connection pool, a
