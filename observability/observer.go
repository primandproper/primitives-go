// what makes a span's instrumentation scope predictable: it is always the
// component's own name, never whatever the caller happened to name a tracer it
// built itself. A constructor that accepted a ready-made tracing.Tracer would
// scope its spans by accident, so none of them do.

// an unconfigured component traces nowhere rather than panicking.

// component's lifetime is stated once at construction instead of at every call
// site — and, more to the point, cannot be stated at some of them and forgotten
// at the rest.
//
// They are seeded before the caller's own BeginOptions, so an operation may
// still override one.

// exported interface: a method would break every implementation outside this
// module, and the values are known where the observer is built anyway.
