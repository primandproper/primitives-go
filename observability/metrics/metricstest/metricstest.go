/*
Package metricstest provides metric instruments for tests.

It is a separate package rather than a file in observability/metrics because
anything importing "testing" from a non-test file drags the testing package —
and, here, shoenig/test — into every production binary that transitively imports
it. Consumers reach for these from their own _test.go files, so the split costs
them nothing.
