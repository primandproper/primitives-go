// how long it took.
//
// The three belong together because none of them means anything alone. A
// climbing error count is a crisis or a rounding error depending on the request
// count beside it; a latency histogram with no request count cannot distinguish
// "fast" from "idle". Twenty-five constructors had built this trio by hand, and
// what varied between them was only which suffixes they chose — which is the
// one thing that should not vary.
//
// The zero value is usable and records nothing, so a component that has no
// metrics provider does not need a nil check at each call site.
