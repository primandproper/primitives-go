// Package tableaccess is the SQLite database.Manager, and every one of its
// operations refuses.
//
// SQLite has no users, no roles, no grants, and no notion of several databases
// on one server: a database is a file, and access to it is access to the file.
// There is nothing for the interface's methods to do, so each reports
// ErrNotSupported rather than pretending to have provisioned something.
//
// It exists so that dialect selection stays uniform — a service configured
// against SQLite still resolves a database.Manager — and so the refusal is
// visible. Every method opens a span and records the error, because a caller
// finding out at runtime which dialect it was handed should see the refusal in
// the same trace it would have seen the grant in; a refusal that leaves no trace
// cannot be told from a call that never happened.
//
// Provisioning a SQLite deployment is a filesystem matter: file permissions and
// where the file lives, not statements sent to a server.
