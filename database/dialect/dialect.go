/*
Package dialect names the SQL dialects the module's SQL-emitting packages
support, and carries the small helpers every one of them otherwise reimplements:
bind-marker rendering, identifier vetting, and DDL statement splitting.

It exists to be a leaf. database/migrate, outbox, and authorization/database all
speak the same three dialects, and their migrations subpackages cannot import
their parents without closing a cycle through the parents' tests — so before
this package, each of the five declared its own Dialect type and tests converted
between them. One shared type makes those conversions unrepresentable.
