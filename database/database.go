	// unreachable except via WithTransaction, so statements cannot accidentally run
	// outside a transaction or against the read replica.

		// and nothing previously stopped the pair disagreeing — a caller could hand
		// dialect.MySQL to a store backed by a Postgres client and get syntactically
		// valid SQL that the server rejects at runtime. Sourcing the dialect from the
		// client makes that mismatch unrepresentable rather than merely unlikely.

		// the sole executor, commits on a nil return, and rolls back on error or panic.
		//
		// fn receives only an executor, not the transaction handle: it cannot commit or
		// roll back. Returning an error (or panicking) is the sole way to abort, and drives
		// exactly one rollback — so fn can't roll back and then also return an error, which
		// would otherwise trigger a redundant second rollback.

	//
	//	raw, ok := client.(database.RawAccess)
	//
	// Reaching for RawAccess is a deliberate step outside the safe Client surface; prefer
	// Reader, Writer, and WithTransaction wherever they suffice. Providers may expose
	// further, provider-specific capabilities the same way — e.g. the postgres package's
	// PgxAccess, which exposes the native pgx pools backing these handles.
