/*
Package ddl renders a package's embedded schema against a dialect and a table
prefix, and vets the prefix against every identifier the schema would create.

It exists because six packages in this module ship the same three .sql files and
the same forty lines of Go to render them: pick the body for the dialect,
substitute the prefix, split on semicolons, and check the result is a legal
identifier. Six copies is six chances for one of them to drift — and one of them
already had, in the one place drift is invisible: whether the prefix carries its
own trailing separator or the template supplies it.

Like database/dialect, this is a leaf. A migrations subpackage cannot import its
parent without closing a cycle through the parent's tests, so the shared pieces
have to live below both.

# How a table name is built

A name has three parts, and only the first is configurable:

	ddb          _  audit_log   _  entries
	consumer        component      table
	namespace       segment

The component segment is owned by the schema and baked into its DDL, so a table
always says which package created it. A consumer reading their schema cold can
tell audit_log_entries from metering_events without consulting this module.

The namespace is the caller's, and is optional. Empty renders the component's
own names — audit_log_entries — which is what a consumer with one application per
database wants. Setting it to "ddb" renders ddb_audit_log_entries, which is what
a consumer sharing a database between applications wants:

	CREATE TABLE {{PREFIX}}audit_log_entries
	         ""  -> audit_log_entries
	      "ddb"  -> ddb_audit_log_entries

The separator belongs to the renderer, not the caller: a non-empty namespace has
'_' appended once, here. A caller who passes "ddb_" would otherwise render
ddb__audit_log_entries — legal SQL, and a table nobody meant to name — so a
namespace ending in '_' is rejected rather than silently accepted.
