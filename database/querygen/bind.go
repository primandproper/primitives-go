// A statement in this package names its arguments — created_after, cursor,
// result_limit — and something has to turn a name into the spelling the
// consumer parses. sqlc reads `sqlc.arg(created_after)` and generates a struct
// field from it; a database driver reads `$3` and takes a positional slice. The
// SQL either side of that spelling is the same SQL, and it is the part with the
// semantics in it: which bound admits NULL, whether the archived flag gates the
// exclusion or admits rows, that the cursor predicate is absent from the counts.
//
// Those semantics are the kind that can be wrong twice — a runtime renderer that
// wrote its own archived predicate the other way round would behave correctly
// until someone removed a redundant IS NULL elsewhere, and nothing would tie the
// two renderings together. So there is no second renderer. The Bound* methods
// below call the same statement builders StandardCRUD calls, and rewrite the
// argument references in what comes back.

// ErrUnboundableStatement indicates a statement that has no executable
// rendering, because the number of placeholders it needs is not known until the
// values are.
var ErrUnboundableStatement = platformerrors.New("statement cannot be rendered as bound SQL")

// sqlcArgument matches an argument reference in emitted SQL: the required and
// nullable forms, the set form that has no single rendering, and the bare `?`
// that is MySQL's page size.
//
// The name alphabet admits '#' because sqlc's own expansion of a set synthesizes
// one name per element, and a synthetic name has to be unmistakable for a real
// one. No identifier dialect.ValidIdentifier accepts contains a '#', so the two
// cannot collide.
//
// The bare marker is here because one argument cannot be named in the SQL that
// declares it: MySQL's grammar takes a placeholder after LIMIT and nothing else,
// so Generator.limitClause writes the marker itself. It is unambiguous — no
// other fragment this package emits contains a '?', and LIMIT is the clause a
// statement ends on, so the marker is matched where it appears like every other
// and lands last in Bound.Args.
var sqlcArgument = regexp.MustCompile(`sqlc\.(n?arg|slice)\(([a-zA-Z0-9_#]+)\)|\?`)

// bindArguments rewrites a statement's sqlc argument references into d's bind
// markers, returning the statement a driver takes and the argument each marker
// stands for, in the order the driver takes them.
//
// This is a rewrite of the emitted text rather than a second way of rendering
// it, and that is the point rather than an expedient. sqlc performs exactly this
// rewrite on these same statements before its generated code hands one to a
// driver, so a bound statement is the generated one by construction — there is
// no pair of renderers to drift, and no fragment that could render correctly for
// one consumer and wrongly for the other.
//
// It also has to be a pass over the finished statement rather than a decision
// made while rendering one. A fragment here is rendered once and spliced more
// than once: filterPredicates goes into the SELECT's WHERE and into both count
// subqueries, so created_after appears three times in a list query from one
// rendering of it. Numbering at render time would give that one rendering one
// marker and record one argument while the statement carried three, and would
// additionally make the argument order depend on the order Go happened to
// evaluate the arguments of the Sprintf that assembled the statement. Numbering
// the finished text has neither problem: a marker is numbered where it appears,
// however it got there.
//
// What differs per dialect is only whether a repeat is one argument or several.
// Postgres numbers its markers, so repeats reuse the first occurrence's number
// and the value is bound once. MySQL's and SQLite's are positional — a bare `?`
// takes the next value and there is no way to name an earlier one — so there
// each occurrence appends the name again and the caller binds the value as many
// times as it appears. Both are correct; only the count differs, and Bound.Args
// reports whichever one this dialect produced.
//
// SQLite's own syntax does have a numbered form (`?NNN`), but dialect.Placeholder
// does not emit it, and treating SQLite as numbered here would collapse a
// repeat's arguments while leaving its markers in place — a statement that binds
// every value after the first into the following slot rather than one that fails
// to parse.
//
// A set reference has no rendering at all: sqlc.slice is a macro sqlc expands
// per call, because the number of markers a set needs is not known until the
// values are. None of the Bound* methods renders one — idSetPredicate is the
// only fragment that does, and only off Postgres — so reaching one here means a
// new Bound* method was written around a statement whose arity belongs to its
// caller, and that method owes its caller a count. It is a programming error,
// and says so the way the rest of this package does.

// asks something narrower and per-statement: this table's reads are open within
// its scope but only its owner may write, so the get names one predicate column
// and the update names two. Expressed as one call over one options struct that
// would be a set of per-query overrides; expressed as five calls it is five
// argument lists.
//
// Each takes the extra predicate columns as Match values, and the row's own id
// is one of them where it applies rather than a special case — which is what
// lets a caller add a tenancy scope column without this package knowing what a
// tenancy scope is. Each is a call into the statement function StandardCRUD
// calls, so what a store executes is what a generator would have emitted.
//
// None of them requires an id column, which is where they part company with
// StandardCRUD. A table whose primary key is (subject_type, subject_id) names
// both in Match values and addresses a row exactly; the id predicate is rendered
// only when the column list has one, the same way every other predicate here is.
// What such a table cannot have is the paged list, whose cursor is the id — see
