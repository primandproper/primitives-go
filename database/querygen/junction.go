// A junction list is the one read this package emits that spans two tables: a
// page of one table's rows reached through a junction — the row that says a
// user belongs to an account, that a document is tagged, that a subscription
// covers an event type — and, where the caller wants them, the junction's own
// columns beside them.
//
// It is deliberately one join rather than a join builder. Every read of this
// shape in this module is the junction pattern, which is this module's own
// convention rather than a consumer's schema: a table keying two owned entities,
// with facts of its own. A general builder would have to accept an arbitrary
// FROM clause, and there is no caller for one — where the narrow shape can widen
// later at a known cost, the wide one can never narrow.
//
// What it is not is a second rendering of a filtered list. The paged form is
// listStatement with a join spliced into its FROM, so the window, the archived
// toggle, the cursor and the two counts are the same code path a single-table
// list goes through, and a junction list filters exactly as an unkeyed one does
// because there is nothing that could make it not.

// ErrIncompleteJunction indicates a Junction that describes half a join: no
// table, or a table with no pair of columns to match it on.
//
// It is rejected rather than ignored because ignoring it fails quietly. A
// Junction whose Table was left empty still carries its Matches, and dropping
// them silently is a keyed read that lost its key — every row in the table,
// returned without an error, under a query name that says otherwise. A list with
// no join says so by passing no Junction at all.

// Junction is the second table a junction list reads through: how it is joined,
// what it contributes to the WHERE clause, and whether its columns are projected
// beside the listed table's.
//
// A nil *Junction is no join at all. That is what a read of the junction's own
// rows takes — a user's memberships, keyed on the user — and it is why
// [Generator.JunctionListAllQuery] takes one rather than assuming one.

	//
	// It is not decoration and it is not optional for a projection. Two tables
	// following this module's row conventions share most of their column names,
	// so an unaliased two-table projection has two columns called id, two called
	// scope, and two called created_at. What a generator downstream makes of
	// that is its own business — sqlc suffixes the repeats with an ordinal — and
	// the result is a row type whose field names depend on the order the SELECT
	// happened to list its tables in. Naming the prefix is what keeps the row
	// type readable and stable; requiring it for a projection is what makes the
	// unaliased case unrepresentable rather than merely discouraged.

	// Columns is Table's full column list, in the order a projection should

	//
	// It is the whole list rather than the projected subset, because the

	// statement here derives its predicates: a joined table with an archived_at
	// is required to be live, and one without it is not asked to be. A caller
	// that wants the join's predicates and none of its columns supplies the
	// columns and no Prefix.
