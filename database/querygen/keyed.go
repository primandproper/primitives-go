// The statements StandardCRUD emits key a row on its own id and, where the
// caller named one, on an ownership column. That covers a table whose primary
// key is a surrogate id and whose reads are all of the same shape, and it covers
// nothing else: a get keyed on a natural key, a list keyed on a reference, an
// update guarded by the value it is replacing, a read projecting one column.
//
// The forms below are those variants, in the same canonical sqlc spelling the
// standard set is emitted in. Each calls the statement function StandardCRUD
// calls, with the matches where WithOwnership's column goes, so a variant is
// the standard statement with more predicates rather than a second rendering of
// one — the filter window, the archived toggle, the cursor and the two counts
// are the same code path, and there is no pair of renderers to drift.
//
// They are one per statement rather than one call returning a set. StandardCRUD
// answers a generator binary asking "what queries does this table need", where
// the set is the unit and a table gets all of it. A store's corpus asks
// something narrower and per-statement: this table's reads are open within its
// scope but only its owner may write, so the get names one predicate column and
// the update names two. Expressed as one call over one options struct that would
// be a set of per-query overrides; expressed as six calls it is six argument
// lists.
//
// Each takes the name, because a query file's names have to be unique across the
// consumer's whole sqlc package rather than merely within one file, and nothing
// here knows what else that package holds. None of them takes an ownership
// column: a variant's predicates are its matches, which is where the owner goes.
//
// None of them requires an id column, which is where they part company with
// StandardCRUD. A table whose primary key is (subject_type, subject_id) names
// both in Match values and addresses a row exactly; the id predicate is rendered
// only when the column list has one, the same way every other predicate here is.
// What such a table cannot have is the paged list, whose cursor is the id — see
// ErrMissingIDColumn and the package comment. A single-row statement with no id
// and no Match keys on nothing at all, and panics with ErrUnaddressableRow
// rather than addressing every row in the table.

// Match is a predicate on one column, for a read keyed on something other than
// the row's own id — comments on one reference, signups for one waitlist, or
// the whole key of a table whose primary key is natural rather than a surrogate
// id — and for the guards a write puts its own correctness on.
//
// It is a column name rather than rendered SQL because the statements it lands
// in render it more than once: a list query carries its predicates in the SELECT
// and again in each of the two count subqueries beside it. A caller handing over
// finished SQL would have to know how many times its argument was about to
// appear, which is a property of the assembled statement rather than of the
// predicate. Handing over the column instead leaves that to whatever renders the
// finished text.
//
// What the column is compared against is [Match.Against] — a bound argument by
// default, and one of a small closed set of things a statement owns otherwise.
// See [Comparand].

	// Column is the column matched. It is bound, never interpolated, so its
	// value needs no escaping; the name itself is interpolated and is therefore
	// restricted — see dialect.ValidIdentifier.
	Column string
	// Arg names the argument the column is compared against, for a predicate
	// whose value is not simply "this column's value". It defaults to Column,
	// which is what every keyed read wants: a get by account binds the account
	// under belongs_to_account and nothing is clearer than that.
	//
	// A guarded write is what needs the other spelling. Naming the current
	// owner in a transfer's predicate as well as the new one in its SET is the
	// whole mechanism that stops two concurrent transfers from both succeeding,
	// and both halves are the owner column — so under one argument name the
	// statement would set the column to the value it was requiring it to
	// already hold, which is legal SQL that guards nothing. Arg is what makes
	// the two ends of that comparison two arguments.
	//
	// It is a name rather than a value, and it is interpolated into the
	// statement the way Column is, so it is restricted the same way.
	//
	// Only the two comparands that bind anything read it — see [Comparand].
	// Naming an argument that a NULL, empty-string or clock comparison has
	// nowhere to put is ErrArgumentlessMatch rather than dead text in a
	// statement.
	Arg string
	// Against is what Column is compared against. The zero value is the bound
	// argument, which is what every keyed read wants; the rest are the guard
	// forms — see [Comparand].
	Against Comparand
	// Exclude inverts the predicate: the rows matched are the ones the
	// uninverted form would have left out.
	//
	// It is a field on Match rather than a second type because the two are the
	// same predicate over the same comparand, differing in one operator, and a
	// caller assembling a mixed key writes one slice either way. The read that
	// wants it against a bound value is the one looking for another row like
	// this one — the remaining live membership when the default is being
	// removed — where the excluded value is as much a part of the key as the
	// included ones.
	//
	// It inverts every comparand rather than only the bound one, and each
	// inversion is a complement rather than a different question: IS NULL
	// becomes IS NOT NULL, `= ''` becomes the not-empty guard, and a clock
	// comparison flips from "at or before now" to "after now". So a guard and
	// the rows it refuses are one Match with one bool between them, which is
	// what keeps "unexpired" and "expired" from being two spellings that can
	// come to disagree about the boundary.

// meaning is the same on all three dialects and whose spelling this package can
// therefore promise; a caller needing something outside it is describing a
// statement that has to be checked by a person, not one this package should
// learn to guess at.
//
// A guard is not decoration. The reason MarkUserTwoFactorSecretVerified names
// [EmptyString] and [NoValue] is that a replayed verification must write
// nothing, and the reason a token consumption names [CurrentTime] and [NoValue]
// is that an expired or already-redeemed token must not be spendable. Each
// reports zero rows when it loses, which is the answer the caller acts on.

	// It is spelled as its own comparand rather than as a bound NULL because
	// `column = NULL` is not false, it is unknown — the predicate every SQL
	// dialect agrees matches no row, including the rows it was meant to match.
	// A nullable stamp is how this module records that something has not
	// happened yet: an unproven secret, an unredeemed token, a key not yet
	// shredded, a row not yet archived. Guarding on it is what makes the write
	// that does the thing happen exactly once.
	NoValue
	// EmptyString compares the column against the empty string: `column = ''`,

	//
	// The empty string is this module's sentinel for a TEXT NOT NULL column
	// holding nothing yet — an outstanding verification token that has been
	// cleared, a two-factor secret that was never issued — so the not-empty
	// guard is "this fact exists" without a second column to record it in.
	//
	// The literal is the statement's own rather than a bound value on purpose:
	// there is exactly one empty string, so binding it would be an argument
	// every caller had to supply and none could get right in more than one way,
	// and a guard that took its own sentinel from its caller would be one a
	// caller could disarm by leaving the argument unset.

	// CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, or `column > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` under
	// [Match.Exclude]. It binds nothing.
	//
	// The uninverted form is the sweep — expired, elapsed, due — and the
	// inverted one is the guard a consumption puts on itself: still live at the
	// moment the row is claimed. Both are the server's clock rather than the
	// application's, for the reason [NowExpression] gives: a row's timestamps
	// and the comparison against them have to come from one clock, or two
	// application instances a second apart decide differently about the same
	// row.
	//
	// The boundary is inclusive on the expired side, so a row whose deadline is
	// exactly now is past it. That is the reading that leaves no instant at
	// which a row is neither live nor expired.
	CurrentTime
	// OptionalArgument compares the column against an argument the caller may
	// leave unset: `column = COALESCE(sqlc.narg(name), '')`, or `<>` under
	// [Match.Exclude].
	//
	// It is the presence-conditional predicate, and it is one static statement
	// rather than two texts assembled per call. The excluded form is the one
	// with callers: a uniqueness check that must not collide with the row it is
	// about to update excludes that row's id, and the same check at creation
	// time excludes nothing — so the argument is absent, the COALESCE yields
	// the empty string, and the predicate excludes an id no row has.
	//
	// That correctness rests on the same fact [Generator.CursorCondition]
	// rests on: no id is empty. A column whose domain includes the empty string
	// is a column this comparand cannot speak for, because an unset argument
	// would then name a row.
	OptionalArgument
	// AtMostArgument compares the column against a bound ceiling: `column <=
	// sqlc.arg(name)`, or `column > sqlc.arg(name)` under [Match.Exclude].
	//
	// It is [CurrentTime]'s bound sibling — the horizon a caller computed
	// rather than the one the server reads off its own clock — and it is what a
	// retention sweep is keyed on: everything recorded before this instant,
	// everything sequenced at or below this number. The clock form cannot
	// express either, because the horizon a sweep runs to is now less a window
	// the configuration carries, and interval arithmetic is the arithmetic the
	// three dialects spell three ways.
	//
	// So the subtraction happens in Go and arrives bound, which is the same
	// thing a filter window's created_before already does. The skew that
	// introduces is the application's clock against the server's, and it is
	// bounded by the window: a cutoff a second early deletes a row a second
	// early, against a horizon measured in days.
	//
	// It is also the comparand for a deadline the application stamped from a
	// clock it was handed, where [CurrentTime] would be the wrong clock rather
	// than merely the inexpressible one: a deadline written as now-plus-a-TTL
	// from an injected clock, compared against the server's, is two clocks
	// deciding one row — and under a test clock that only moves when a test
	// moves it, the two are years apart. Binding the same clock's reading puts
	// the comparison back inside one clock, which is the property CurrentTime's
	// doc asks for rather than an exception to it.
	//
	// The boundary is inclusive on the doomed side, for [CurrentTime]'s reason
	// — that is the reading which leaves no value at which a row is neither
	// past the horizon nor short of it — and Exclude is its complement rather
	// than a different question.
