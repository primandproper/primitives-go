// two transforms that are supposed to agree are two transforms that can drift.

// wrote it the scan walked a column nothing maintained — so the statement that

//
// The ids arrive as a set bound in one argument rather than one statement per

// reaches the server differs by dialect and the Go signature does not — see

// are deliberate. This is the search sync's own machinery servicing itself — it
// stamps the rows an index accepted, which it named explicitly — rather than a
// consumer read that owes a tenancy scope. And a row whose archived_at is set is
