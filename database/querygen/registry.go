// ErrNilRegistry indicates WithRegistry was handed no registry. Registering

// rather than treated as an absent option.
var ErrNilRegistry = platformerrors.New("registry is nil")

// Registry is the set of table names a generator knows about.
//
// It answers one question, and the question is not about SQL: which tables does
// this application have? A consumer needs that list for the things that are
// per-table but not per-query — the TRUNCATE an integration suite runs between
// tests, a schema inventory, a migration audit — and the list has to be complete
// or the symptom is not a failure where it was made. A table missing from a
// maintenance TRUNCATE is a test somewhere else failing later because the
// previous test's rows are still there.
//
// The reason it lives here rather than in the consumer is that a table's SQL and
// a table's existence are separate facts, and a consumer that derives the second
// from the first loses a table the moment something else starts producing its
// SQL. That is not hypothetical: a query builder per table doubles as a table
// list right up until one table stops needing a builder, and then the list is
// short by one with nothing to say so. Registering the name is what survives the
// thing that emitted the queries going away.
//
// So [Generator.StandardCRUD] registers every table it emits for, and anything
// else that owns a table registers it too — by hand, from a declaration, from
// whatever produces its SQL — into the same registry. Two sources, one list, and
// no rule anybody has to remember.
//
// A Registry is safe for concurrent use. Registering the same table twice is
// how the ordinary case works rather than a mistake to guard against: a
// generator emitting for more than one dialect calls StandardCRUD once per
// dialect for each table, so the second and third registrations are the same
// name arriving again.

// looks, because a registered name is not merely stored — a consumer reads this
// list back and interpolates every entry into statement text, which is a place
// arbitrary strings do not belong. The panic value is an error wrapping

// passes over the same tables. A consumer that writes this list into a file — or
// asserts the committed one still matches, which is how a generator is usually
// checked in CI — wants the list to move when the schema does and not when
// somebody reorders a switch statement.
//
// It is deliberately not an ordering a caller can delete in. Foreign keys make
// deletion order a fact about the schema, which a set of names cannot express,
// so a consumer truncating these tables wants the dialect's own way of ignoring
// the constraints — TRUNCATE ... CASCADE, a disabled FK check — rather than a
