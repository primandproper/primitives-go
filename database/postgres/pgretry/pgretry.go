// Package pgretry re-runs a Postgres write that failed for one of the two
// reasons Postgres resolves by asking the caller to run it again.
//
// Two packages in this module — workqueue and timers — own a table that several
// processes claim rows out of, and both had written the same loop by hand: the
// SQLSTATE pair, the retryable test, the attempt-bounded loop, and the bounded
// rendering of a cause into a nullable last_error column. The copies were
// identical down to the doc comments, which is the argument for one home: the
// next transient SQLSTATE worth surviving should be added once, not found in
// two places by whoever notices the first copy.
//
// It is deliberately about Postgres. The condition it recognizes is a class 40
// SQLSTATE reported by pgconn, and a caller running against MySQL or SQLite has
// neither those codes nor this failure mode.
