// channel, the identifier vetting, the backoff. Nothing there can tell whether
// LISTEN is actually issued, whether a notification crosses the wire, or
// whether a dropped session comes back listening — which is the whole of what
// this file covers, and the only place that can.

// microseconds, so anything approaching this is a failure rather than a slow
// machine.
