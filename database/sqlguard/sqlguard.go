// Package sqlguard runs the guarded write four durable-state packages in this
// module are built on, and says what it means when the guard matches nothing.
//
// A guarded write is an UPDATE whose WHERE clause encodes the state its caller
// believed the row was in — "finish this operation, if it is still running",
// "advance this saga, if it is still on the step I read". Matching zero rows is
// not an error the driver reports; it is a success that recorded nothing, and
// the whole reason the guard is in the statement is to notice. operations,
// dataprivacy, saga and metering had each written the same seven-step handling
// of that by hand: exec, read RowsAffected, stamp the span, and on zero mark
// the span, count the miss, log the identifier, and return a wrapped sentinel.
//
// The copies had already begun to differ — metering logs no identifier and
// returns an ad-hoc error where its siblings return a package sentinel — which
// is the argument for one home. What varies between callers is what the row is
// called and what a missed guard means to that caller, and that is exactly what
// a Guard carries.
