// It exists because some models embed the two sides differently — Cohere's v3
// models take an input_type and place a query and a passage in deliberately
// different regions of the space, so that a query vector lands near the
// passages that answer it rather than near the passages that resemble it. Get
// the side wrong and both halves of the comparison are still vectors, the
// search still returns results, and only the ranking is quietly worse. There is
// no error to catch, which is why the caller has to be able to say.
//
// Providers whose models are symmetric — openai and ollama here — embed the
// same text identically either way and ignore this field; each says so in its
// package documentation. Setting it against them is harmless, and portable: the
// same Input can be handed to a symmetric provider today and an asymmetric one
// after a config change without the caller re-examining its call sites.

// narrowing happens once per response on the way out of each provider. Three
// byte-identical copies of a four-line loop is not a crisis, but it is three
// places for the precision decision to be made independently, and the decision
// is the interesting part: float32 is what pgvector and Qdrant store, so
// keeping float64 through this layer would double every payload for precision
// that is discarded at the next hop.

// A nil or empty input yields an empty, non-nil slice, so a caller ranging over
