// Package noop is the email.Emailer that sends nothing. SendEmail accepts every
// message and returns nil, so password resets, receipts, and verification links
// are addressed, rendered, and dropped — with no bounce, no provider-side log,
// and no error for anyone to notice.
//
// The absence of a signal is what makes it a test and local-development choice
// and a hazard anywhere else. A deployment that reaches this by accident reports
// itself healthy while every user waiting on a verification link is stuck, and
// nothing in the metrics distinguishes that from a quiet week. email/config
// builds it only for the "noop" provider name; an unrecognized name is
// errors.ErrUnknownProvider.
