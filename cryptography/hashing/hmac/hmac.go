// It is the shape every multi-key verifier in this module needs, because every

// through a rotation window, and a provider may present several signatures in
// one header for the same reason. Both loops therefore run to completion —
// returning as soon as something matches makes the time taken depend on which
// key and which candidate agreed, which is exactly the distinction Equal's
// constant-time comparison exists to hide, given back one key at a time.
//
// The cost of not short-circuiting is nothing: the lists are a handful of keys
// held during a rotation, not an unbounded set.
//
// No hashers or no candidates is not a match. A verifier holding no keys
// accepts nothing, which is the only safe reading of "we cannot check this".
