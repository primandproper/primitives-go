// Package sha256 implements hashing.Hasher using SHA-256, producing a 32-byte
// digest.
//
// It is a cryptographic hash: finding a second input with the same digest is
// not practical, which is what makes it suitable for content addressing,
// integrity checks, and fingerprints. Two things it is still not. It is
// unkeyed, so anyone can recompute a digest over content they chose — proving
// who computed it needs the hmac sibling. And it is fast, which is the wrong
// property for a stored password; use authentication/argon2 there.
//
// Prefer it over sha512 when digest size matters, and sha512 when it does not:
// on 64-bit hardware SHA-512 is usually the quicker of the two.
