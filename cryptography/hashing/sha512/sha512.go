// Package sha512 implements hashing.Hasher using SHA-512, producing a 64-byte
// digest.
//
// It is a cryptographic hash: finding a second input with the same digest is
// not practical, which is what makes it suitable for content addressing,
// integrity checks, and fingerprints. Two things it is still not. It is
// unkeyed, so anyone can recompute a digest over content they chose — proving
// who computed it needs the hmac sibling. And it is fast, which is the wrong
// property for a stored password; use authentication/argon2 there.
//
// The digest is twice the width of the sha256 sibling's, and on 64-bit hardware
// is usually computed faster. Prefer sha256 only where the extra 32 bytes per
// digest are worth having back.
