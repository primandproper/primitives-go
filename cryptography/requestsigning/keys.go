// the life of the process is a key that cannot be rotated without a restart,
// which is why signing material tends to sit in config files and never change.

// window and may be empty, which is the steady state; a previousName that
// resolves to secrets.ErrSecretNotFound, or to an empty value, is treated the

// because a signer with no key is a signer that cannot sign and a verifier with
// no key would accept nothing.
//
// # Rotation
//
// Reading per operation is what makes rotation a secret-store change rather
// than a deploy, and it is only affordable because secrets.NewCachingSource
// exists: wrap the provider in one and these reads are answered from memory,
// with the backend consulted once per TTL. Pair it with secrets.WithRefresh so
// a rotation is noticed on a timer instead of on the next request, and with
// OnChange if something else in the process must be told.
//
// The values are used as key material verbatim, with no decoding. A secret

// decodes it, so that what the store holds and what the HMAC consumes cannot
