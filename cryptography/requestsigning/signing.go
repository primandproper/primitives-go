//	<scheme>.<unix timestamp>.<body>
//
// The scheme and the timestamp are inside the signed material rather than
// merely alongside it, and both are load-bearing.
//
// The timestamp is what makes a captured request expire. Signing the body alone
// produces a signature valid forever, so anyone who observes one request can
// replay it against the receiver indefinitely.
//
// The scheme prefix is what makes the construction replaceable. Without it, a
// v2 that signed different material could be substituted by an attacker for a
// v1 signature over material that happens to coincide, and a receiver accepting
// both schemes during a migration would have no way to tell them apart. Binding
// the scheme into the signed bytes means a v1 signature can only ever verify as
// v1.

// an instant of downtime with whoever operates the sender: it accepts either
