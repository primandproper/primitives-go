// RegisterEncryptorDecryptor registers an encryption.EncryptorDecryptor — a
// keyring — with the injector.
//
// Consumers must provide an encryption.Keyset into the container (e.g. via
// do.ProvideValue(i, encryption.Keyset{"k1": material})). The keyset is
// resolved as its named type rather than a bare map so it cannot collide with
// an unrelated map registered in the same container.
//
// Every key the deployment can still decrypt with belongs in that keyset, not
// just the current one. A keyset trimmed to the current key alone makes every
// ciphertext written before the last rotation unreadable, and it does so
// silently until something tries to read one.
