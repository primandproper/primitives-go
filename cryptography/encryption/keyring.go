	// Rotation is deliberately lazy and the ring does not perform it. Naming a
	// new current key means new writes use it and old ciphertexts keep opening
	// under the keys they name; moving the old rows over is a re-encrypt on
	// next write plus a sweep for rows that are never written again. A ring
	// that re-encrypted eagerly would turn a configuration change into an
	// unbounded write amplification against the database.
	//
	// Retiring a key is therefore the dangerous operation, not adding one.

	// stop being readable — permanently, if the material is gone. The
	// decryption metrics exist to make that backlog visible before it becomes
