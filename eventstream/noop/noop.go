// Package noop is the eventstream implementation for a caller with no transport
// to stream over. Send accepts and discards; Receive returns a channel nothing
// ever sends on, closed by Close along with Done, so a bare range over it ends
// when the stream does — the same moment the websocket and sse implementations
// close theirs, and the reason a consumer written as a range loop terminates
// here instead of parking a goroutine for the life of the process.
//
// The upgraders are the part to read twice. UpgradeToEventStream and
// UpgradeToBidirectionalStream take the http.ResponseWriter and never touch it:
// no SSE preamble and no WebSocket handshake is written, and the connection is
// never hijacked. The response therefore remains entirely the handler's to
// complete, which is the opposite of what every real upgrader leaves behind. A
// handler written against a real upgrader and run against this one will write a
// body the client reads as an ordinary HTTP reply.
//
// Close closes the Done channel exactly once, so shutdown paths that wait on
// Done still finish, and is idempotent on both channels. eventstream/config
// offers only sse and websocket, so this one is reached by naming it in code.
