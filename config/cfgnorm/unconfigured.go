// UnconfiguredToNil releases the pointer sub-config fields of cfg that hold
// nothing the operator supplied.
//
// It is ZeroToNil scaled up one level, and it exists because ZeroToNil stops
// working once a sub-config stops being a leaf. Two things put a value into a
// freshly parsed sub-config without anyone asking for it:
//
//   - `env:",init"` recurses. Allocating *databasecfg.Config also allocates the
//     `,init` pointers nested inside it, so the outer struct is not zero even
//     though nothing was configured.
//   - `envDefault:` fills fields in. databasecfg.Config parses to
//     provider=postgres with four populated timeouts and pool sizes in an empty
//     environment, so it is never zero either.
//
// Under a plain ZeroToNil both of those read as "the operator configured this",
// which at a composition root means every subsystem is switched on by the act
// of parsing. So the comparison is against what the type itself parses to in an
// empty environment rather than against its zero value: whatever env parsing
// supplies on its own is not configuration. For a leaf config carrying no
// defaults the two are the same check.
//
// A sub-config the operator did fill in — in a file, in the environment, or by
// assignment afterwards — differs from that baseline and is left alone. The
// converse is the documented edge: a block that spells out nothing but the
// library's own defaults configures nothing, and is released.
//
// cfg must be a non-nil pointer to a struct. Only its own pointer-to-struct
// fields are considered; normalizing further down is each sub-config's own
// business, and it happens in their ValidateWithContext.
