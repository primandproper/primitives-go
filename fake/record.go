// BuildFakeRecord builds a fake X shaped like something this platform stores.
//
// The builders above hand back what faker produced, which for a type that is written
// to a database and read back is not quite a usable value: an identifier field gets
// random letters, a timestamp gets sub-second precision in local time, and every
// pointer and slice gets filled, which is the opposite of what an optional field and a
// child collection mean to the store. A caller then either fixes all of that by hand,
// which is the composite literal they were trying to stop writing, or writes tests
// that fail for reasons that have nothing to do with the code under test.
//
// So the value is generated and then walked, and what comes back is:
//
//   - a field named like an identifier holds a real identifier
//   - a time.Time is truncated to the second and in UTC
//   - a pointer, slice, map or interface is nil
//   - a float is a whole number
//   - everything else is what faker produced
//
// What that leaves for the caller is the fields whose values the type constrains — a
// status from a closed set, a URL that has to resolve, a minimum that has to be below
// its maximum — which are the fields worth reading in a builder anyway.
//
// The caller's options are applied over the two this needs, so an option named here
// can still be overridden; see BuildFakeForType for why order settles that. It panics
// for the reason MustBuildFake does.

		// other map anyway: absent, for the caller to fill if it means something.

// an identifier holds a well-formed value of the right shape that nothing joins on,
