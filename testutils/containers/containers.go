// fn receives the container itself along with tb.Context(); it is not handed a
// shutdown closure, because it does not own shutdown.

// Termination is registered with tb.Cleanup rather than deferred until fn returns.

// returns *before* those subtests execute, and a deferred Terminate would pull the
// container out from under them.

// it up to a parent that runs unrelated work afterwards.
