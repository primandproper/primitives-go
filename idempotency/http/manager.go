// A 4xx is a stable answer: the same request will be rejected the same way, so
// replaying it is both correct and cheaper than running the handler again. A
// 5xx is not. It usually means the work never landed, and pinning it for the
// whole TTL would leave a client unable to ever succeed with that key — so the
// claim is released and the next attempt runs the handler.
//
// The cost of that choice is the one hole in the guarantee: a handler that has
// its effect and then fails will repeat the effect on retry. Recording 5xx
// instead trades that rare case for a common and worse one.

//
// Options are appended after the default, so a caller passing their own
// idempotency.WithRecordable still wins.
