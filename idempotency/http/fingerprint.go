// fingerprint identifies the request a key is being used for.
//
// It covers more than the body on purpose. A key that only committed to a body
// would let the same payload posted to two endpoints — or by two different
// users — share one record, and the second caller would be handed the first's
// response. So the method, path, query, and principal all go in.
//
// The query is taken from Query().Encode(), which sorts by key. Using RawQuery
// would make ?a=1&b=2 and ?b=2&a=1 different requests and report an ordinary
// retry as key reuse.
//
// The body is hashed as raw bytes, which is strict: a client that
// re-serializes its JSON between attempts changes the fingerprint and is told
// it reused its key. That is the safe direction to err in — the alternative is
// deciding two different payloads are the same — and WithFingerprint exists
// for callers who want to canonicalize instead.
