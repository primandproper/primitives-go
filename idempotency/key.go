// reused for two different requests would replay the first answer instead of

// and base64url tokens clients actually send while excluding control
// characters and anything that would travel badly in a header.
//
// identifiers.Validate is deliberately not used. It accepts only xid, and the
// keys arriving here are minted by third-party clients — rejecting a
// well-formed UUID would break every caller that does the ordinary thing.
// Generating a key is the other direction; see WithNewKey.
