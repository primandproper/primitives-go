// It records success and the client-fault codes, and refuses the server-fault
// ones. The split is the gRPC counterpart of the HTTP 4xx/5xx line and rests on
// the same reasoning: a client-fault answer is stable, so replaying it is both
// correct and cheaper than running the handler again, while a server-fault
// answer usually means the work never landed. Pinning that for the whole TTL
// would leave the caller unable to ever succeed with the key.
//
// The cost is the same hole HTTP has: a handler that has its effect and then
// fails will repeat the effect on retry.
