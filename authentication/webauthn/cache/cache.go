/*
Package cache stores WebAuthn ceremony state in a cache.Cache.

It is the store for a deployment that has redis and no relational database.
Ceremony state is small, lives for about a minute, and is discarded on use,
which is the shape a cache is best at — and unlike the session table, nothing
here has to be swept, because the cache reclaims its own entries.

# Where it stops

Consume is a read followed by a delete, not one operation, because the
cache.Cache seam has nothing that fetches and removes atomically. Two requests
answering the same challenge in the same instant can therefore both be handed
the ceremony, where authentication/webauthn/database hands it to exactly one.
The window is the microseconds between the two round trips, and what fits in it
is a replay of an assertion the legitimate user just made — so the practical
cost is that one authentication may be counted twice, not that a stale
assertion becomes usable later. A deployment that wants the stronger guarantee
uses the database store, and this package declares the deviation to the
conformance suite rather than quietly passing it.

# A memory cache is not a deployment

Backed by cache/memory this store is per-process, which is exactly the failure
the WebAuthn ceremony is prone to: the challenge is issued by one replica and
answered on another, and the login fails for no reason the user can act on. Use
redis, or use the database store. Memory is for tests and for a single-process
service.
