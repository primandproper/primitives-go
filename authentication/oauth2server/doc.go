/*
Package oauth2server is an OAuth 2.1 authorization server: the endpoints, the
grant logic, and a Store seam underneath them.

	store, _ := oauth2database.NewStore(&oauth2database.Config{}, db)

	srv, _ := oauth2server.NewServer("https://auth.example", store, authenticator)
	srv.Mount(router)

It exists because a resource server whose clients discover it at runtime and
hold no pre-registered client identifier has to be an authorization server —
protected resource metadata (RFC 9728), authorization server metadata (RFC
8414), authorization code with PKCE, and dynamic client registration (RFC 7591)
— and that is a lot of protocol to assemble out of the reference examples. The
examples are map-backed, so every assembly from them is map-backed, and a
map-backed authorization server works exactly until there are two replicas.

None of this is specific to any one protocol built on top of it. The same
endpoints serve any RFC 7591 client.

# What you have to supply

Two things, and they are the two this package must not decide.

A SubjectAuthenticator says who the human at /authorize is. One deployment
checks a username, an argon2 password, and a TOTP code against its own identity
repository; another already has a session cookie; another delegates to a
corporate identity provider. There is no default, because a default would be a
server that issues authorization codes to whoever asks.

A Subject says what a token means. ID is the "sub"; Claims is whatever the
resource server needs beside it — an account identifier, a tenant, a role — and
this package neither reads it nor constrains it beyond requiring strings.

Everything else has a default, the login form included: see DefaultLoginRenderer
for a plain page that works with no stylesheet and no assets, and
WithLoginRenderer for replacing it.

# The endpoints

	GET  /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server   RFC 8414 discovery
	GET  /authorize                                the login form
	POST /authorize                                authenticate, issue a code
	POST /token                                    authorization_code, refresh_token
	POST /register                                 RFC 7591 dynamic registration
	POST /revoke                                   RFC 7009 revocation

Mount registers all six on a routing.Router; Handler returns them as one
http.Handler for a caller not using routing. The seventh document — RFC 9728
protected resource metadata — is emitted by the resource server, which is not
necessarily this process, so it is a separate mountable thing: ResourceMetadata.

# The decision with the most reach: what an access token is

An access token here is opaque, and every resource-server request that carries
one costs a lookup in the Store. The alternative — a signed
authentication/tokens JWT or PASETO, verified locally — is a real option that
this package deliberately does not take, and the reasoning is worth having in
the open rather than inherited from whichever was written first.

A signed token makes verification free and revocation impossible. What carries
revocability then is the refresh token, which means a sign-out ends the session
at the end of the access token's lifetime rather than now — so the access token
lifetime becomes a direct trade against how long a revoked session keeps
working, and the pressure is always to make it shorter, which puts the load back
on the token endpoint.

An opaque token makes revocation immediate and verification a lookup. The Store
is required either way, for authorization codes and client registrations, so the
opaque choice adds no dependency; it adds a query on a primary key, on a table
whose live rows are bounded by (sessions × access token lifetime).

Immediate revocation is the property this package is unwilling to give up. It
ships a /revoke endpoint, and an endpoint that answers 200 to "end this session"
and then leaves the session working for another quarter of an hour is worse than
not shipping one. Server.Authenticate is how an in-process resource server does
the lookup.

The cost is stated plainly rather than hidden: a resource server in a different
process cannot call Authenticate, and this package ships no RFC 7662
introspection endpoint for it to call instead. Share the Store, or hold the
resource server in the same process.

# The access token lifetime

Fifteen minutes, and it is the number this package most deliberately did not
inherit. The examples this generalizes use twenty-four hours, and they use it
because their store is a map: a restart would otherwise sign everybody out, so
the token had to outlive the process. With a durable store and a rotating
refresh token behind it, a long-lived bearer token buys nothing — the session
already survives — and costs the entire window in which a leaked one works.

# What is checked, and why each one is not a follow-up

Three of these are the difference between an authorization server and something
that looks like one, and all three are cheap while the interface is being drawn
and awkward afterwards.

Redirect URIs are matched exactly, byte for byte, against the ones the client
registered — at /authorize, and again at /token against the URI the code was
issued for. Not a prefix, not "same host", not "ignoring the query string".
Where the registered URIs are stored and never read again, any redirect_uri a
request supplies receives an authorization code; PKCE keeps whoever receives it
from redeeming it, so that is a leak rather than a takeover, but registration
was supposed to be what stopped it.

Client secrets are verified at /token, against the registration rather than
against whatever the authorization code recorded. A metadata document that
advertises client_secret_post from an endpoint reading no secret makes
registration decorative.

Tokens carry an audience, from RFC 8707 resource indicators, so that a token
minted for one resource server cannot be replayed at another. A resource server
that finds its own identifier absent must refuse the token; this package cannot
make that check on its behalf.

Every credential is stored as a hex SHA-256 digest and never as itself, so a
database dump contains nothing redeemable — invisible in a map that dies with
the process, and the entire difference once the store is a table.

PKCE is mandatory and S256-only. There is no option to disable it and no support
for the "plain" method, which puts the verifier in the request PKCE exists to
protect.

Refresh tokens rotate and reuse is detected. Rotation alone is bookkeeping: the
replayed token is refused and the copy the attacker is using keeps working, so
the theft leaves one failed request and no other trace. What makes it worth
doing is that a replay revokes the whole family — see RefreshToken.FamilyID.

# What it does not implement

The implicit grant and the resource-owner-password grant, both removed by OAuth
2.1. There is no option that brings them back, because an option is a thing a
deployment can be misconfigured into.

Token introspection (RFC 7662) and consent screens beyond the login form. The
first is discussed above; the second is application-shaped in the same way the
login form is, and WithLoginRenderer is the seam for it.

Rate limiting /register. It is unauthenticated by construction — RFC 7591
requires that for discovery to work — so bounding it matters, but who a caller
*is* depends on a deployment's proxy, gateway, and address handling in ways not
visible from in here. Mount takes middleware for exactly this; ratelimiting has
the middleware.

# Choosing a store

oauth2server/database keeps four SQL tables, and is what a deployment wants.
oauth2server/memory keeps four maps, and is for tests and single-process
development. They are held to the same conformance suite,
oauth2server/oauth2servertest, including the two cases that separate them: a
code redeemed twice concurrently, and a record that expires between a read and
the write that follows it.

oauth2server/config assembles either from environment configuration, with a
do.Provide registration.

# Watching it

	oauth2server_requests                by endpoint: metadata, authorize, token,
	                                     register, revoke.
	oauth2server_errors                  by endpoint and OAuth error code. A rising
	                                     invalid_grant on the token endpoint is
	                                     usually a client with a broken PKCE
	                                     implementation; a rising invalid_client is
	                                     usually a registration that lapsed.
	oauth2server_latency_ms              by endpoint.
	oauth2server_codes_issued            authorization codes. Should track logins.
	oauth2server_tokens_issued           token pairs, from both grants.
	oauth2server_clients_registered      dynamic registrations. This is the one an
	                                     anonymous caller drives, so a spike here
	                                     is the signal that /register needs a rate
	                                     limiter in front of it.
	oauth2server_refresh_reuse_detected  replayed refresh tokens and codes. Not
	                                     always an attack — a client that lost the
	                                     response to a refresh and retried lands
	                                     here too — but never nothing.
	oauth2server_revocations             records revoked, by /revoke and by reuse
	                                     detection together.

No credential appears on a span or in a log line, hashed or otherwise: a hash of
a bearer credential is the store's lookup key for it. The client identifier is
recorded, and is public by construction.
