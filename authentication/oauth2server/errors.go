// Store sentinels. Every Store implementation reports these and nothing else
// for the four outcomes a caller has to branch on, which is what lets the
// server's grant logic be written once against the interface rather than once
// per backend.
//
// ErrExpired and ErrAlreadyRedeemed wrap ErrNotFound, so a caller that only
// needs "this credential is not usable" checks that one. The distinction
// matters in exactly one place and it is the important one: a code or refresh
// token that comes back ErrAlreadyRedeemed is a replay, and a replay is the
// signal that revokes a token family. An ErrNotFound is a typo.

	// wraps ErrNotFound.
	//
	// A store reports it rather than pretending the record is absent so that
	// the expiry is decided against one clock — the store's — instead of being
	// re-derived by every caller that reads the record. See Store for why the
	// check has to happen inside the same statement that consumes it.

	// ErrAlreadyRedeemed indicates a one-time credential was presented twice.
	// It wraps ErrNotFound.
	//
	// Consuming methods return the record alongside this error, deliberately.
	// The record names the token family, and revoking that family is the whole
	// point of detecting the replay: without it, rotation rejects the copy the
	// attacker holds and leaves the copy the victim holds working, so nobody
	// finds out.
	ErrAlreadyRedeemed = platformerrors.Wrap(ErrNotFound, "oauth2 credential already redeemed")

	// ErrRecordExists indicates a create was given an identifier already in
	// use.
	//
	// Every identifier this package mints carries 256 bits of entropy, so this
	// means a store was handed one it did not mint rather than that two
	// credentials collided. It is an error rather than an overwrite because the
	// overwrite would be silent, and what it would silently discard is a live
	// credential somebody is holding.
	ErrRecordExists = platformerrors.New("oauth2 record identifier already in use")

	// ErrClientExists indicates a client was registered under an identifier
	// already in use. It wraps ErrRecordExists.
	//
	// It has its own sentinel because registration is the one create an
	// anonymous caller drives, so it is the one a caller is likely to branch
	// on: a silent overwrite there would let one anonymous caller take over
	// another's client by guessing an identifier.

	// resource behind it, so a token minted for one of them is a token the
