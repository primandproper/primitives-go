// TokenAuthenticator resolves a bearer credential to the access token record
// behind it, and is the seam a Verifier stands on.
//
// *Server implements it, and in the ordinary deployment — resource server and
// authorization server in one process, which is what opaque tokens require —
// that is what a Verifier is handed. It is an interface rather than a *Server
// so that a resource server holding only the Store, or a test wanting a
// controlled answer, has something to pass; it is deliberately the narrowest
// possible one, because a Verifier needs to look a token up and nothing else.
type TokenAuthenticator interface {
	Authenticate(ctx context.Context, bearer string) (*AccessToken, error)
}

// Verifier is the resource server's half of this package: the checks a request
// carrying a bearer token has to survive before a handler sees it.
//
// The authorization server mints tokens; a Verifier decides whether the one in
// front of it authorizes this request, at this resource. Three checks, and the
// package would be incomplete without all three:
//
//   - the token is live. Delegated to TokenAuthenticator, which reads it from
//     the Store — the lookup that opaque tokens are for, and the reason a
//     revoked session stops working now rather than in fifteen minutes.
//   - the token names this resource. RFC 8707 puts the resource identifier in
//     the token's audience so a token minted for one resource server cannot be
//     replayed at another; a resource server that does not compare it has the
//     field and not the property.
//   - the token carries the scopes the route requires.
//
// The second is the one that gets left out, and it is the one this type exists
// for. Server.Authenticate hands back a live token whoever it was minted for,
// because it is the authorization server's lookup and the authorization server
// serves every resource behind it. A deployment running two resource servers
// against one authorization server — an HTTP API and an MCP endpoint, which is
// the shape that keeps arriving — has a cross-resource replay the moment one of
// them treats "Authenticate returned a token" as "this request is authorized".
//
// It is not specific to any protocol built on top of it. An MCP server is an
// http.Handler and mounts behind Middleware; so does a REST API, and a resource
// server with its own response envelope calls Verify and writes its own.
