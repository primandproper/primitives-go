	// not inherit. The examples this is a generalization of use twenty-four
	// hours, and they use it *because* their store is a map: a restart would
	// otherwise be visible to every signed-in user, so the token had to outlive
	// the process. With a durable store and a rotating refresh token behind it,
	// a long-lived bearer token buys nothing and costs the entire window in
	// which a leaked one works.

	// Seven days. It is the credential that carries revocability here — the

	// revokes the whole family.

	// anonymous writer; an expiry is what bounds it without anybody having to
	// decide which rows are garbage. A client still in use re-registers on its
	// next discovery, which under RFC 7591 it already knows how to do.
	//
	// Set it to zero for registrations that never lapse, and then answer the
	// question of what removes them.

// application does not have to POST an empty body to a URL whose parameters are
// all in the query string.
//
// It is a separate seam rather than a second mechanism inside
// SubjectAuthenticator on purpose. Which of "presented a credential" and "typed
// a password" wins is a protocol question, and folding both into one method
// leaves every deployment to answer it slightly differently; here the answer is

// /register is unauthenticated by construction — RFC 7591 requires that, or a

// so it is the one endpoint here an anonymous caller can write rows through,
// and bounding how fast it may is a deployment's to decide. It is a deployment's
// because *who a caller is* is: an address is a proxy's unless the proxy is
// trusted, a header is whatever an API gateway was configured to set, and
// neither fact is visible from in here. So this package supplies the seam and
// the deployment supplies the answer.
//
// The gate is a routing.Middleware, which is what ratelimiting/http.NewMiddleware
// returns:
//
//	limiter, err := ratelimiting.NewInMemoryRateLimiter(1, 5)
//	gate, err := ratelimitinghttp.NewMiddleware(limiter, ratelimitinghttp.KeyByRemoteAddr())
//	server, err := oauth2server.NewServer(issuer, store, authenticator,
//		oauth2server.WithRegistrationLimiter(gate))
//
// It is an option rather than a Mount argument because a gate passed to Mount
// is a gate on all six endpoints, and mounting the handlers individually to
// reach one of them is a router-shaped answer that has to be rewritten for
// every router. Set here it wraps RegisterHandler itself, so Mount, Handler,
// and a deployment mounting the endpoint by hand all get it and none of them
// had to know.
//
// The gate runs before anything this package does, so a refused request costs
// no store read, spends no registration policy, and appears in the middleware's
// own counters rather than in oauth2server_requests — a refusal is not an
// attempt this server declined, it is one it never saw.

//
// It is on by default because a client that discovered this server at runtime
// holds no pre-registered identifier, and registration is what it does about
// that. Turning it off is a deployment saying its clients are administered
// somewhere else — created through a permission-gated API, seeded by a
// migration — for which an anonymous endpoint writing to the same client table
// is a way around those permissions rather than a second way into them.
//
// It turns the endpoint off in all three places at once, which is the whole
// reason it is one switch and not a router decision: Mount and Handler stop
// routing /register, RegisterHandler answers 404 to a deployment that mounted
// it by hand, and Metadata omits registration_endpoint. The document naming an
// endpoint that 404s is the failure the metadata is written to avoid with the
// sign flipped — and naming it as an empty string would be worse still, since a
// client resolving "" against the issuer gets this server's root.
//
// What it does not touch is the clients already in the store. Turning

// same empty 200 whether a token was revoked or was never there, so a consumer
// that wants to emit its own "this user signed out" event cannot tell the two
// apart from the outside. See RevocationObserver for when it is called and what
