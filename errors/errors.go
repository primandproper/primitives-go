	// an operator is owed the reason.

	// ErrUnrecognizedInputValue indicates an input that was supplied, is not
	// empty, and is not one of the values the callee accepts — an enum member
	// from a newer client, a misspelled state, a provider name with a typo.
	//
	// It exists because the alternative in practice was to reach for
	// ErrEmptyInputProvided, which says the opposite of what happened. A caller
	// that branches on "they left it out" and gets it for "they sent something I
	// do not know" writes the wrong remedy, and an operator reading the log is
	// told a field was missing while the request plainly carried it.
	//
	// Like every sentinel here its message reaches clients verbatim, so it names
	// no value; wrap it with the offending one.
	ErrUnrecognizedInputValue = crdberrors.New("input provided is not a recognized value")

	// ErrPermissionDenied indicates the requester lacks the authority to perform
	// the action. It lives here rather than in the authorization package so that
	// errors/http and errors/grpc can map it without importing authorization,
	// which imports them back.
	//
	// Its message is deliberately generic: it reaches clients verbatim, and the
	// specific permission that was missing must not.
	ErrPermissionDenied = crdberrors.New("permission denied")

	// ErrResourceInUse indicates the request conflicts with the current state of
	// the resource — most often a delete of something another record still
	// references. It is a client-correctable conflict, not a server failure: the
	// same request may succeed once the references are gone.
	//
	// It lives here rather than in a data-access package for the same reason
	// ErrPermissionDenied does: errors/http and errors/grpc map it, and neither
	// may import a package that imports them back.

	// ErrNotEntitled indicates the account's plan does not include the feature
	// the request needs. It is a billing answer rather than a security one: the
	// caller is who they say they are and may do what they asked, they simply
	// have not bought it.
	//
	// It is distinct from ErrPermissionDenied for that reason. Collapsing the two
	// would answer a customer who needs to upgrade with the message shown to one
	// who needs a different role, and would put a paid feature behind a status
	// code that tells a client to stop rather than to buy.
	//
	// It lives here rather than in the entitlements package so that errors/http
	// and errors/grpc can map it without importing entitlements — which would
	// drag a SQL store, a job scheduler, and a message queue into the import
	// graph of the package every handler already depends on.
	ErrNotEntitled = crdberrors.New("not entitled")

	// ErrQuotaExhausted indicates the account is entitled to the feature and has
	// consumed all of it for the current billing period.
	//
	// It is distinct from ratelimiting.ErrRateLimited, which says a request came
	// too fast and will succeed shortly. This one says a period's allowance is
	// spent, and the remedies — wait for the period to roll, or buy more — are
	// neither of them "retry in a moment". A client told the wrong one retries
	// for a month.
	//
	// It lives here for the same reason ErrNotEntitled does.
	ErrQuotaExhausted = crdberrors.New("quota exhausted")

	// ErrUnknownProvider indicates a config named a provider the package does
	// not implement — a typo, or a provider from a newer version of this module.
	//
	// It lives here so that every config subpackage reports the same failure the
	// same way, and so a consumer's startup path can branch on one sentinel
	// rather than on a dozen package-local ones. Constructors wrap it with the
	// offending value; they never substitute a noop implementation, because a
	// misconfigured provider that silently discards its work is a production
	// incident that looks like a healthy process.
	ErrUnknownProvider = crdberrors.New("unknown provider")

// ErrNilInputProvided is ErrNilInputParameter under its other name.
//
// The two were distinct values naming one condition, and which one a package
// returned was a coin flip — cookies returned this one, circuitbreaking's config
// returned the other, and a caller wanting to catch "something was nil" had to
// test for both or pick wrong. They are now the same value, so either name
// matches whichever a package happens to return.
//
// Deprecated: use ErrNilInputParameter.
