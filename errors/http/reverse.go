// ErrorForCode returns the platform sentinel an ErrorCode was mapped from, or
// nil when the code has no single sentinel behind it.
//
// This is the direction a client reads. A service answers 429 with code E116;
// its typed client parses the envelope and, rather than handing its caller an
// HTTP status to switch on, hands back ratelimiting.ErrRateLimited — the same
// sentinel a caller inside the serving process would have gotten, matched the
// same way with errors.Is. That is what makes a remote call substitutable for a
// local one at the error boundary.
//
// The returned error is the sentinel itself, unwrapped and unannotated. Callers
// that want the remote context on it should wrap it with their own.
//
// A nil result means only that this package cannot name the error; it does not
// mean the response was a success. Fall back to the status code.
