	// well-formed, the caller is authenticated and authorized, and the thing

	// "this existed as a one-time thing and is finished" — spent, expired,
	// revoked, or aged out of retention. Gone says that and says it is
	// permanent, which is the one part a client must not get wrong: a 404
	// invites a retry of a URL that will never work again, and every retry of a
	// link is somebody clicking it a second time.

	// 400 for both search pagination refusals, and not 416, which was the other
	// candidate. RFC 9110 scopes 416 to the Range header — a response carrying it
	// is expected to carry Content-Range, and intermediaries and client libraries
	// treat it as a byte-range answer — so borrowing it for a cursor the server
	// itself issued means a status whose accompanying headers cannot be provided
	// and whose meaning has to be documented away. 400 is also what gRPC's own
	// OutOfRange maps to at every gateway, so a service exposing both transports
	// answers the same refusal the same way. The distinction 416 was wanted for
	// survives where clients can actually read it: in the two error codes.
