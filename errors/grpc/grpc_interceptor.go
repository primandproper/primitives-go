// outermost-first — depth-first through a Join, in the order it was joined —
// and each node is compared against the client-safe sentinels, registered and
// platform alike; the first node that is one of them supplies the message. So a
// more specific wrapper outranks what it wraps: a domain sentinel declared as
// Wrap(platformerrors.ErrUnrecognizedInputValue, "...") and registered speaks

// EncodeError and DecodeError round-trip an error's cockroachdb *mark* — its
// type name and message — and not the identity of the sentinel value. So a
// decoded ErrUserNotFound is a different pointer from the one the package
// declared, and std errors.Is walks the chain comparing pointers and finds
// nothing. cockroachdb's own matcher compares marks and finds it.
//
// errors.Is consults an Is method when a value in the chain has one, so
// delegating here means a caller writes the obvious thing:
//
//	if errors.Is(err, identity.ErrUsernameTaken) { ... }
//
// and it is true. Without this method that line compiles, reads correctly, is
// always false, and sends a registration down the "something went wrong" branch
// on a collision the server named precisely. Telling callers to reach for a
// different matcher was the alternative, and a rule that has to be remembered at
// every call site is not a rule.
//
// The limitation, stated plainly: a mark is a type chain plus a message, not an
// identity. Two sentinels declared with identical wording in different packages
// carry the same mark, are indistinguishable after a round trip, and errors.Is
// on what came back answers true for both of them. The module therefore keeps
// its sentinel messages unique across packages, and internal/sentinelmatrix
// enforces that rather than leaving it to review.

// DecodeErrorFromStatus on its own is a function every call site has to wrap its
// result in, and the one that forgets gets a *status.Error that no errors.Is
// matches — which reads exactly like a server that failed to encode, and is why
// the encoding side has been an interceptor from the start and this side was
// not. The two are now symmetric: the server encodes on the way out, the client
// decodes on the way in, and the sentinel a store returned is the sentinel the
// caller compares against.
//
// The error it returns answers to both idioms — see decodedError — because
// making the decode automatic would otherwise silently break every caller that
// reads status.Code, which is the more common of the two and the one nobody
// would think to re-check after installing an interceptor.
//
// Std errors.Is works on what it returns, which is not free — see decodedError's
// Is method for why it takes one, and what the alternative silently cost.
//
// Unary only, and that is narrower than the encoding side: the server has
// StreamErrorEncodingInterceptor, so a streaming RPC's error does cross the
// wire encoded, but nothing on the client decodes it yet. A client of a
// streaming RPC therefore gets a *status.Error that std errors.Is does not
// match, and DecodeErrorFromStatus is what such a client calls by hand today.
