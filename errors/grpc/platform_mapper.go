// PlatformMapper maps platform-level errors to gRPC codes.
// It does not depend on any domain.
//
// It covers the same sentinel set as the HTTP mapper, and deliberately so: a
// service exposing both transports would otherwise answer the same failure with
// a considered status on one and codes.Unknown on the other, and which one a
// client got would depend on how it happened to connect.

	// change system state, and paying for a subscription is not a state change
