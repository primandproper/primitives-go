// Package receivewait paces a consumer's receive loop after a failed receive.
//
// A broker's own long-polling paces the loop while it is working; a receive that
// fails returns immediately, so a persistent failure — expired credentials, a
// deleted queue, a partitioned broker — spins the loop as fast as the CPU and
// the broker's API allow, burning a core and the request quota for as long as it
// lasts. Every consumer therefore needs a wait here, and the two that had one
// disagreed about what it should be: SQS grew from 100ms to 30s, Kafka paused a
// flat 250ms forever.
//
// Neither jittered, which is the part that matters at fleet scale. A broker that
// goes away takes every consumer with it at the same instant, and un-jittered
// backoff has them all come back at the same instant too — turning a recovering
// broker's first moment back into the same thundering herd that is still
// arriving when it falls over again.
