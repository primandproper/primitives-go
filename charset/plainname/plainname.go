// Package plainname validates plain names: the ones an operator writes into
// config — a plan name, a meter name — that then travel into cache keys,
// idempotency keys, metric attribute values, and permission strings.
//
// It is named for what it validates rather than for "identifier", which is the
// public identifiers package's word for a minted opaque ID. The two answer
// unrelated questions — is this string one I generated, versus may this name go
// where it is about to go — and the near-collision read as a typo at every call
// site that imported one while meaning the other.
//
// Those destinations are the reason the rule is restriction rather than
// escaping. None of the four has a quoting convention a producing package could
// rely on, and the cache key is the one that matters most: a separator that can
// appear inside a component is a key collision, and a key collision there serves
// one subject another's answer.
//
// This is deliberately narrow. Packages whose names travel somewhere else — a
// SQL identifier interpolated into query text, a saga step name that is a
// component of a colon-separated key — have their own rule and their own
// validator, because the charset each admits follows from where the name goes
// rather than from a shared notion of "identifier".
//
// The alphabet below comes from the charset package, and that does not soften
// the point. What is shared there is the set of bytes and the scan over them;
// what is not shared is which bytes, and why. A caller reading the rule reads it
// on this line rather than being sent to a common predicate to find out what it
// currently means — which is the thing worth refusing, and is why charset offers
// no way to hand it an arbitrary function.

// run into does.
