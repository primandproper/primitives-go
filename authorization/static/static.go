// Package static provides an authorization.PolicyResolver whose policy is
// fixed at construction.
//
// This is the default backend, and the one to reach for until something forces
// otherwise: it needs no database, no migrations, and no configuration, and it
// resolves without I/O. Policy lives wherever the caller declares its roles —
// as Go constants, or as YAML loaded into a config struct.
//
// Graduate to authorization/database when roles themselves must become editable
// data: when an operator has to define a new role, or change what an existing
// one grants, without shipping a release. Reassigning a principal's roles does
// not require it — role assignments belong to the consumer either way.
