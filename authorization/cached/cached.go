// Package cached wraps any authorization.PolicyResolver in a cache.
//
// It is a decorator rather than a third backend: it composes with static (where
// it is redundant) and with database (where it is the difference between a
// query per session build and a query per policy change).
//
// The cache is keyed by role names, not by principal. That is what makes it
// worth having — a deployment with five roles has five hot entries shared by
// every principal, rather than one per user, so the hit rate approaches one and
// the memory cost does not grow with traffic.
//
// # Why caching is safe here and would not be elsewhere
//
// A resolved PermissionSet may live in a cache. It may never live in a
// credential. That distinction is the reason this package's seam sits at the
// resolver: a cache entry that fails to decode after a deploy degrades to a
// query, while a session or token that fails to decode logs its holder out.
// This package is consequently the only place in authorization where an
// encoding change can bite, and the only place where being bitten costs
// nothing — keys carry a format version, and any decode failure is treated as a
// miss rather than an error.
//
// The cost of caching is staleness: a policy edit takes effect when the entry
// expires, not immediately. Invalidate narrows that window in the process that
// made the edit; other replicas wait out the TTL. Set the TTL to the longest
// delay you would accept between revoking a role's authority and it taking
// effect everywhere.
//
// Both invalidation methods are declared by authorization.PolicyInvalidator, so
// a caller holding the interface authorizationcfg returns can type-assert for
// that rather than for this concrete type.
//
// # What it reports
//
// Hit and miss counts come from the cache backend itself — cache/redis and
// cache/memory both emit them — so this package does not restate them. What it
// adds is the fault path, which the cache cannot report because from its side a
// stale or undecodable entry is a served result:
//
//   - authorization_cached_read_faults, entries that could not be read and
//     degraded to the inner resolver.
//   - authorization_cached_write_faults, resolutions that could not be stored.
//     A sustained rise here looks like a permanently cold cache, not a broken
//     one, which is why it is worth a counter of its own.
//
// Each resolution also carries keys.AuthorizationCacheOutcomeKey on its span, so
// a single slow request can be attributed to a miss without reading counters.
