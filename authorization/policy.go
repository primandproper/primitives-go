// Role is a named grant of permissions, optionally inheriting from other roles.

// in, and authorization/database.Seed writes it to tables. That is what makes
// the two interchangeable, and it is the fix for the failure mode where a
// code-side role table and a database seed drift apart because nothing checks
// them against each other.

// concrete type it was handed — whether a cache sits in the chain is a
// configuration decision, and the position of the cached decorator inside the
// returned resolver is an implementation detail:
//
