// The instrument names, and the attributes that tell one recording from another.

// These used to be seven instruments whose names embedded the bucket:
// fmt.Sprintf("%s_saves", cfg.BucketName+"_uploader") and six more like it. That
// made a config string part of metric identity, with two consequences. Two
// services writing to the same bucket reported into one series while one service
// writing to two buckets reported into two unrelated ones, neither of which a
// dashboard could aggregate. And a bucket name is not an instrument name:
// OpenTelemetry accepts [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_./-]{0,254}, so a perfectly ordinary
// S3 bucket name beginning with a digit failed instrument construction, which
// this package reports as a startup error.
