// Package redisclient builds the go-redis client every Redis-backed package in
// this module talks through.
//
// Five packages — cache, distributedlock, ratelimiting, and the messagequeue
// consumer and publisher — each open their own connection from their own
// address list, and each had written the same single-node-or-cluster dispatch
// by hand. The copies disagreed on the two things that matter: whether a
// connection carries timeouts at all, and what happens when the address list is
// empty. Two of them answered the second question with a nil client, which is
// not a configuration error at startup but a nil-pointer panic on the first
// cache read.
//
// So the dispatch lives here once, with the timeouts as the shared default and
// an empty address list as an error a constructor must handle. What stays with
// each package is the interface it narrows the client to: this returns
// go-redis's UniversalClient, and every caller assigns it to a hand-written
// interface naming only the commands it issues, so a package that never
// publishes cannot publish.
