// Sink persists captured records. Calls arrive from the Recorder's single

// whatever record types the composition emits — raw events, aggregate
// rollups — and must not retain the value past the call.

// Recorder is the bridge between a hot path and a Sink: Record is a
// non-blocking bounded-channel send (a full buffer drops the event and counts
// it — capture never slows a request), and a single flusher goroutine (Run)
// consumes the channel, writing raw events and running the configured hooks.
// See the package documentation for the lifecycle rationale.
