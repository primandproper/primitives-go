// Package noop is the retry.Policy that does not retry: Execute calls the
// operation once and returns whatever the operation returned.
//
// The error a caller sees is therefore the first attempt's, unwrapped and
// unaggregated — no backoff was slept, no jitter strategy consulted, no attempt
// budget consumed. That is precisely what is wanted when the operation is not
// idempotent, when a layer above already owns the retry budget, or in a test
// where real backoff would trade correctness for wall-clock time.
//
// Holding no schedule, it is also the one policy that cannot be misconfigured:
// there is no interval to get wrong and no ceiling to exceed.
// retry/config builds it for the "noop" provider name.
package noop
