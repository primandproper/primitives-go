// It exists because not every caller can retry by sleeping. Execute owns its
// loop and can wait in place; a worker that persists "try again at T" into a
// row cannot, because the wait has to survive the process. Both want the same
// schedule, and computing it twice is how the two quietly stop agreeing.
//
// Jitter is deliberately not applied here. Sleeping and scheduling want
// different distributions — Execute uses retry.Equal to keep a floor under each
// wait, while a fleet writing wake-up times wants retry.Full to spread them —
// so the shared part is the schedule and the caller decides how to perturb it.

//
// The schedule is DelayFor's, so a persisted retry and a retry.Policy grow their
// delays identically from the same Config. What differs is everything around it:
// the wait survives a process restart because it is a column rather than a
// goroutine, and the jitter is retry.Full rather than retry.Equal — several
// workers share one table, and spreading their next attempts across the whole
// window is what keeps them from re-colliding on every round after one contended
// claim. The floor is what makes that safe for a caller who cannot sleep off a
// near-zero draw.
//

// value below 1, negative included, is treated as the first attempt rather than
