// DelayFor returns the backoff before attempt, which is 1-indexed: attempt 1 is
// the first retry and waits InitialDelay. The delay grows by Multiplier per
// attempt and is capped at MaxDelay. An attempt below 1 is treated as 1.
//
// It exists because not every caller can retry by sleeping. Execute owns its
// loop and can wait in place; a worker that persists "try again at T" into a
// row cannot, because the wait has to survive the process. Both want the same
// schedule, and computing it twice is how the two quietly stop agreeing.
//
// Jitter is deliberately not applied here. Sleeping and scheduling want
// different distributions — Execute uses equal jitter to keep a floor under
// each wait, while a fleet writing wake-up times wants full jitter to spread
// them — so the shared part is the schedule and the caller decides how to
// perturb it. Callers pass a Config that has been through EnsureDefaults;
// DelayFor does not mutate its argument.
