# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Go library (`github.com/primandproper/primitives-go`) providing the infrastructure primitives cloud-native services are built from: database, caching, messaging, observability, secrets, uploads, email, and more. Single module, v1, Go 1.27.

**The module is empty today.** Its packages arrive in one move from `platform-go`, with history preserved, in primandproper/primitives-go#2. What is here now is the toolchain, CI and the rules below.

## What belongs here, and what does not

Read this before proposing a package, and before adding an import.

> **primitives-go ships what every service is built from and no service is.** Four kinds of thing qualify: a provider behind an interface (`cache`, `email`, `messagequeue`, ...); a transport whose shape is decided by something other than the consumer's domain (a probe, a protocol, a middleware contract, a third party's payload); the database and schema tooling stores are built with (`database` and its subpackages, `filtering`); and the cross-cutting values both tiers have to agree on (`tenancy.Scope`, the `errors` sentinels, `clock`). Nothing in it owns a table.
>
> **`platform-go` ships what a product has**: a noun with a table, its lifecycle, its transport, its permissions and its privacy obligations. The test for a new package is whether an application with no users would still need it. If yes, it is a primitive.

Three consequences worth stating separately, because they are the ones that get violated:

- **Nothing here owns a table.** No DDL, no migrations, no `Store` over a noun of the consumer's. `database` is the tooling stores are built *with*, which is the opposite thing. The `sqlc-gen-unison` toolchain, the `unison.yaml` files and the dialect matrix stay in platform-go with the stores; there is no `make unison` here and there should not be one.
- **This module never imports platform-go.** Not in a test, not behind a build tag, not "just for the sentinel". The dependency runs one way, and it is what the split bought. A primitive that finds it needs a domain package has found a seam to invert: the domain package exports the value and platform-go's `service` registers it, which is how the error mappers work.
- **Cadence is the point.** This is the slow tier. A breaking change here bumps the major for every consumer, including one that only wanted a fix in `retry`, so a change that can be additive should be.

## Common Commands

```bash
make format         # Format all Go code (imports, field alignment, tag alignment, gofmt)
make lint           # Run golangci-lint (Docker) + shellcheck
make format lint    # Typical workflow: format then lint
make test           # Run tests (race detector, shuffle, failfast)
make build          # Build all packages
make generate       # Regenerate moq mocks after changing any mocked interface
make proto format   # Regenerate the Go bindings for the .proto files this module ships
make setup          # Install dev tools + download deps
```

Run a single test:
```bash
go test -run TestFunctionName ./package/path/...
```

Run tests for a single package:
```bash
go test -race ./cache/...
```

Linting runs in Docker (`golangci/golangci-lint` image). Formatting runs locally with `gci`, `goimports`, `betteralign`, `tagalign`, and `gofmt`.

**This module does not vendor its dependencies.** `go` resolves through the module
cache, and there is deliberately no `vendor/` directory or `make revendor` — a
vendor directory does not track `go.mod`, and once one exists every `go` command in
the tree silently prefers it, so a dependency bump or a branch switch leaves the
next command failing with go's "inconsistent vendoring" wall, printed by whatever
tool happened to run next. The containerised linter gets a bind-mounted module and
build cache (`GO_CACHE`) instead, which is what `vendor/` was really buying.

(`reflection/ast` reads a *consumer's* `vendor/` directory when one is present.
That is a feature of the library and unrelated to how this repo builds itself.)

## Import Ordering

Import ordering uses `gci` with four sections, separated by blank lines:

1. Standard library
2. `github.com/primandproper/primitives-go` (this module)
3. `github.com/primandproper` (org-level packages)
4. Everything else (third-party)

The Makefile `THIS` variable must be the full module path (`github.com/primandproper/primitives-go`). `format_imports.sh` derives the org prefix from it by stripping any trailing major-version suffix (e.g. `/v2`) and then taking `dirname`, yielding `github.com/primandproper`. At v1 there is no suffix to strip, so the two sections differ by one path segment; the `.golangci.yml` `gci` section list spells the same two prefixes and has to be edited with `THIS` or the formatter and the linter will disagree forever. If `THIS` is too short, the org prefix collapses toward `github.com`, creating a spurious `prefix(github.com)` gci section.

## Architecture Patterns

**Interface + multi-implementation:** Most packages define an interface with multiple implementations selected by config. Examples: `cache.Cache[T]` (Redis, memory), `logging.Logger` (slog, zap, zerolog), `secrets.SecretSource` (env, GCP, AWS SSM), `uploads` (S3, GCS, filesystem).

**Config structs:** Each major package has a `config` subpackage using `env:` struct tags and `ValidateWithContext()` via `go-ozzo/ozzo-validation`. Most, but not all, also have `EnsureDefaults()` — packages whose defaults are expressible as `envDefault:` tags use those instead.

Constructors call the validation their config defines, and apply defaults *before* validating: an unset field that has a documented default is not a validation failure, and validating first turns the common case into one. Selecting an implementation is deliberate — an unrecognized provider name returns `ErrUnknownProvider` rather than a working-looking noop. Where a noop is genuinely wanted it has to be named.

**OpenTelemetry throughout:** Database, HTTP, gRPC, and messaging all instrument with OTel for traces, metrics, and logs.

**Error handling:** Uses `cockroachdb/errors` for rich error context. The module's sentinels are defined in `errors/`. Transport mappings live in `errors/http` and `errors/grpc`, which import the packages whose sentinels they map — so nothing in those packages may import `errors/http` or `errors/grpc` back. Neither mapper may import a domain package: a domain package registers its own mapping through `RegisterHTTPErrorMapper` / `RegisterGRPCErrorMapper`, from platform-go, at wiring time.

**Options vs. config seams:** Constructors take `logger`/`tracerProvider`/`metricsProvider` as `WithX` options, never positionally — the `config` subpackages included. A config subpackage constructor reads `ctx, cfg, deps..., opts ...Option`, where `deps` are the things it genuinely cannot build (a `database.Client`, an `*http.Client`, a handler) and everything optional is an option.

Each config subpackage declares its own `Option` type, mirroring the leaf packages, with `WithLogger`/`WithTracerProvider`/`WithMetricsProvider` and a `WithPillars(*observability.Pillars)` that supplies all three at once. Options apply in order, so `WithPillars(p)` followed by `WithMetricsProvider(nil)` leaves that one component unmetered. Absent means noop: every constructor resolves what it was not given through `logging.EnsureLogger` / `tracing.EnsureTracerProvider` / `metrics.EnsureMetricsProvider`, so a caller that wants no observability names none of it. The four pillar subpackages (`observability/{logging,metrics,tracing,profiling}/config`) have no `WithPillars` and cannot: `observability` imports them to build a `Pillars`.

Go allows one variadic per function, and that slot belongs to the config package's own `Option`. A constructor that also passes options through to what it builds exposes them as `WithXOptions(...)` on that same type — `auditcfg.WithRecorderOptions`, `authorizationcfg.WithStaticOptions` — which is also how one wiring site carries options for whichever of several components it builds.

`do.Provide` registrations resolve observability through `observability.InvokePillars(i)` rather than `do.MustInvoke`, so a container that registers none still wires up. It distinguishes "nobody registered one" (absent, fine) from "the registered one failed to build" (an error), so a misconfigured exporter surfaces instead of degrading to a noop that looks configured.

That registration leaves its type argument inferred — `do.Provide(i, func(i do.Injector) (database.Client, error) {...})`, not `do.Provide[database.Client](i, ...)` — because Go derives it from the provider function's return type, where it is already spelled once. Note that this one is convention only: gopls' `infertypeargs` analyzer flags the explicit form, but golangci-lint ships no equivalent, so `make lint` cannot enforce it and a re-introduced type argument will surface in review or an editor rather than in CI.

`do.ProvideValue` is the opposite case, and the contrast is why the rule is not a blanket "never write a type argument". There inference keys the registration on the value's *concrete* type, so `[T]` is load-bearing wherever the key should be something else — registering a concrete under an interface key, or a typed nil, as in `do.ProvideValue[metrics.Provider](i, nil)`. Omit it only when the value's own type is the key, as in `do.ProvideValue(i, cfg)`.

**Provider packages return their own concrete type** — `memory.NewInMemoryCache` returns `*memory.Cache[T]`, `postgres.NewDatabaseClient` returns `*postgres.Client`, `ssm.NewSecretSource` returns `*ssm.SecretSource` — never the interface it satisfies. Returning the interface is a lossy narrowing at the one point where the caller knows most: they picked this provider, and the interface hands back the union of every provider's failure modes and capabilities in exchange. A caller built on `*memory.Cache[T]` writes no `cache.ErrUnavailable` branch, because that cache has no network to lose; a caller built on `*postgres.Client` reads the native pgx pools off the value, without asserting for `PgxAccess`. A `var _ Iface = (*Impl)(nil)` next to the type keeps conformance a compile-time fact.

This holds for an implementation living beside the interface it satisfies, not only for one in a provider subpackage. What it does not reach is an interface *method* that returns the interface — `logging.Logger.WithName` hands back a `logging.Logger` because that is what the interface says, so `zap.Logger.SetLevel` is reachable from what `NewZapLogger` returned and not from what `WithName` derived from it. Where that matters, the constructor's doc says so.

The consequence lands on whoever narrows back to the interface, which is mostly the `config` subpackages. `return memory.NewInMemoryCache[T](...)` from a function returning `(cache.Cache[T], error)` converts a nil `*memory.Cache[T]` into a **non-nil** `cache.Cache[T]` on the error path, so a caller testing the result against nil finds a value that panics on first use. Build the provider into a variable and return it only once its error is known to be nil. This applies wherever a concrete-returning constructor feeds an interface-returning one, `do.Provide` blocks included; a constructor that cannot fail (the noops) needs no such care.

There is one deliberate exception outside the config subpackages: `observability.NewObserver(name, logger, tracerProvider)` is positional everywhere. It is the repo-wide DI seam every package's constructor funnels its options into, called once per constructor and never by consumers, and giving it options of its own would mean every package threading options through to build the thing that consumes its options.

Every package uses `WithTracerProvider(tracing.Provider)` — never a ready-made `tracing.Tracer`, which would let a span's instrumentation scope come from the caller instead of the component. `Option` types are **not** parameterized on their package's generic type, even in generic packages (`cache`, `idempotency`, `eventcapture`): Go cannot infer a type argument from a call's result type, so an `Option[T]` forces every call site to spell `T` out forever. Options that genuinely need the type parameter (`WithCodec`, `WithRecordable`, `WithTransform`, `WithObserver`, `WithKeyOrder`) stay generic but infer it from their argument, and the constructor type-asserts and reports a mismatch.

**Extract what can be got wrong twice, not what is merely written twice.** A
second copy of a naming convention, a precision narrowing, a clock read, or a
SQLSTATE list can be *wrong* — it can drift from the first and nothing will say
so — and those get one home: `observability/metrics.OperationSet` and
`observability.Operation.Time` for the instrument trio and its timing, `pgretry`
for the Postgres write-retry loop, `sqlguard` for the guarded write,
`database.ScanAll` for the rows drain, `retry.Full`/`retry.Equal` for the jitter
strategies, `email.FormatAddress` for the RFC-5322 escaping.

Those two, and `plainname`, `injection` and `cfgnorm`, are exported here rather
than `internal/` as they were in platform-go: the domain tier uses them and a
second module cannot reach `internal`. Exporting them is this module admitting
what it already decided.

A second copy of a *shape* cannot be wrong that way. The provider families —
`llm/{openai,anthropic}`, `embeddings/{openai,ollama,cohere}` — are near-identical
files and are left that way: each is a translation between this module's types
and one vendor's API, so the shape they share is the interface's and the lines
that differ are the ones a reader opened the file for. Factoring them into a base
type with translation hooks trades one readable file for two, at the seam most
likely to move. `llm/doc.go` carries the long form.

The test is whether the copies face the same seam. `featureflags/{posthog,launchdarkly}`
looked like the same case and was not: both evaluate through `*openfeature.Client`,
so only construction and `Close` were vendor-specific and the rest was one
implementation written twice — extracted to `featureflags/internal/openfeatureflags`
and embedded. Two translations to two APIs stay; one implementation against one
seam does not.

## Testing

- **`stretchr/testify` is banned in its entirety** (`assert`, `require`, and `mock`).
  The `depguard` linter enforces this — see `.golangci.yml`. Do not reintroduce
  any testify import.
  - Non-fatal assertions: `github.com/shoenig/test` (package `test`).
    `test.EqOp` for comparable types, `test.Eq` for slices/maps/deep comparison.
    Length/contains helpers have FLIPPED argument order: `test.SliceLen(t, n, slice)`.
  - Fatal assertions: `github.com/shoenig/test/must` (package `must`).
    Same function names as `test`.
  - Mocks: `matryer/moq`, generated from interfaces. See any `<pkg>/mock/doc.go`
    for the `//go:generate` directive pattern.
- Tests call `t.Parallel()` by default
- Container-backed tests use `testcontainers-go`, live in-package (typically `containers_test.go`),
  and gate on `RUN_CONTAINER_TESTS=true` — they skip otherwise. Stand containers up through the
  `testutils/containers` helpers (`pgtest`, `mysqltest`, `redistest`), not raw testcontainers calls.
  A new image belongs in `.scripts/pull_test_containers.sh` too, which pre-pulls the set.
- `make test` runs container tests by default and therefore needs a Docker daemon;
  `.scripts/test.sh false` runs the suite without them
- `make test` runs every package (`./...`)
- Test command: `CGO_ENABLED=1 RUN_CONTAINER_TESTS=<true|false> go test -shuffle=on -race -vet=all -failfast`

## Linting

- 42+ linters enabled via `.golangci.yml` (golangci-lint v2 format)
- Formatters: `gci` and `gofmt` (configured in the `formatters:` section)
- Notable strictness: `errcheck`, `errorlint`, `gosec`, `forcetypeassert`, `unconvert`
- Many linters relaxed for `_test.go` files (gosec, goconst, forcetypeassert, unparam, etc.)
