// Option configures a GroupCommit or a Buffer.
//
// One type serves both, because the two shapes share most of what there is to
// configure — a clock, a flush timeout, an ordering, and the three
// observability pillars — and splitting it would mean two spellings of
// WithLogger. Each option below says which constructor reads it; one that the
// constructor has no use for is accepted and ignored, so a wiring site that
// builds both from one slice of options does not have to sort them out.
//
// Option carries no type parameter even though both shapes do. Go cannot infer
// a type argument from a call's result type, so an Option[T] would force every
// call site to spell the item type out by hand — WithFlushTimeout[MyRow](d) —
// forever. WithMerge and WithOrder are the two options that depend on the item
// type; they stay generic but still need no annotation, because the type is
// inferable from the functions each is handed.

// this option is for: the write function receives the batch in one total order,
// which is the lock ordering that keeps concurrent writers of the same rows
// queueing instead of deadlocking.

// ErrItemTypeMismatch otherwise, since Option cannot carry the item type for the

//
// Applied on top of WithMerge rather than instead of it: merge decides which
// items are written, order decides in what sequence. Supplying both is how a
