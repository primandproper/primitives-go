// The order is the point, not a side effect of using a map. It is the total
// order every writer of the target table acquires locks in, so two processes
// merging different sets of the same popular keys queue behind each other
// rather than deadlocking. A map iteration would give a different order per
// flush, which is the worst case available.
//
// merge has to agree with however the write function resolves a conflict
// against storage. If merging inside the batch were more permissive than
// merging against the table, two callers naming one key would get a different
// result depending on whether they happened to land in the same flush — which
// is the kind of bug that only appears under load. It is called only when there
// is something to fold into; a nil merge keeps whichever item arrived last.
//
// It is a closure over a map rather than a type with methods because it is the
// one place K is known: GroupCommit carries no key type, so the accumulator has
// to erase it, and the erasing is the whole reason this seam exists.
