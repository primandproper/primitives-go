// Package noop is the distributedlock implementation for a deployment with
// nothing to coordinate with: Acquire always succeeds immediately, WithLock
// always runs fn, and TryWithLock always reports the lock as taken.
//
// # This provider is correct at one replica
//
// It provides no mutual exclusion of any kind, which makes it correct at
// exactly one process and silently wrong above that. Two replicas holding "the
// same" lock both proceed into the critical section, and nothing here detects
// the second one or reports the contention it did not arbitrate. It fails as a
// double-processed job or a lost update rather than as an error. That is a
// constraint on the deployment, not a tuning knob — a service that scales out
// wants the redis or postgres provider instead, where the lock lives somewhere
// both replicas can see it.
//
// Its lock handles are real enough to pass around: Key and TTL echo back what
// Acquire was given, and Refresh updates the TTL it will echo. Nothing is
// stored anywhere and no expiry is ever enforced, so a handle that outlives its
// TTL is still held.
//
// distributedlock/config builds either type for the "noop" provider name.
