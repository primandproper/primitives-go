// Package filtering is the shared vocabulary for list queries: which slice of a
// collection a caller asked for, and which slice they got.
//
// A QueryFilter carries the request half — a cursor, a page size, a sort
// direction, created/updated time windows, and whether archived rows count — and
// round-trips through URL query parameters, so the same value is what a handler
// parses out of an *http.Request and what a client puts back on the wire. The
// query-parameter names are exported constants rather than string literals
// spelled out per handler, which is what keeps a client and a server agreeing on
// them. Pagination is the response half, and is what an API response embeds
// alongside its data to say what was applied and where the next page starts.
//
// It builds no SQL and touches no database. This package decides what a caller
// asked for; translating that into a query belongs to whatever store answers it.
//
// Page size is clamped rather than rejected: a request for more than
// MaxQueryFilterLimit gets MaxQueryFilterLimit, and an absent one gets
// DefaultQueryFilterLimit. A parameter that is present and unreadable is a
// different matter, and parsing reports it — every parameter is still attempted
// and everything that parsed is applied, so the filter is always usable, but the
// error is there because a mistyped filter that is silently dropped answers with
// a plausible-looking page that excludes nothing. The handler decides which of
// those it wants; the parse does not decide for it.
//
// A nil *QueryFilter is usable throughout: it renders as the default filter and
// says so when attached to a logger, so handlers need no nil check before
// passing one along.
//
// Cursors are directional, and the two halves of a round trip do not carry the
// same one. A QueryFilter's Cursor is the page being asked for. The Pagination
// that answers it reports PreviousCursor as the cursor that reached this page
// and Cursor as the one that reaches the next, so an empty PreviousCursor is
// the first page. Nothing needs to compare the two against each other to work
// that out, and a caller that does is inferring a contract stated here.
//
// The next cursor is the last row's identifier whenever the page held rows, so
// it is empty only for an empty page. It is not a "there is more" signal: a
// full page and the final page carry an equally non-empty Cursor, and the
// counts are what distinguish them.
//
// Defaults and bounds apply to a filter however it arrived. Parsing one out of
// query parameters is only the transport that has a parser here; Normalize is
// the same rule for a filter decoded from anywhere else, and is what the
// `default` and `maximum` tags on QueryFilter describe to a caller that will
// never call it.
//
// QueryFilterSchema describes the request half as JSON Schema, for the surfaces
// that ask for a filter in that dialect rather than in query parameters: a
// tool-calling model, an MCP tool definition, an OpenAPI document. It is
// reflected off the struct, so it is the one description of this type there is.
